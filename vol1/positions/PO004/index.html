Under their domestic law, a partnership is considered to be liable to tax even though, technically, that tax is collected from the partners or in the case of Morocco from the principal partner; for that reason, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Morocco and Tunisia reserve the right to amend the Article in their tax conventions in order to specify that their partnerships must be considered as residents of their country in view of their legal and tax characteristics.</p>

<p></paragraphsection></positionsonarticle><positionsoncommentary><paragraphsection><title>Paragraph 2</title>9.  In the opinion of <em>Vietnam</em> the personal relations and economic relations mentioned in <a href="#CO004-P014">XREFSTYLE=ParaLabelPlural</a> and <a href="#CO004-P015">15</a> of the Commentary should be separated and one given priority over the other.
