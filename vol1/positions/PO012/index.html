<p>20.  <em>India</em> does not agree with the interpretation in <a href="#CO012-P009.01">paragraph 9.1</a> of the Commentary on Article 12 according to which a payment for transponder leasing will not constitute royalty. This notion is contrary to the Indian position that income from transponder leasing constitutes an equipment royalty taxable both under India’s domestic law and its treaties with many countries. It is also contrary to India’s position that a payment for the use of a transponder is a payment for the use of a process resulting in a royalty under <a href="#A012">Article 12</a>. India also does not agree with the conclusion included in the paragraph concerning undersea cables and pipelines as it considers that undersea cables and pipelines are industrial, commercial or scientific equipment and that payments made for their use constitute equipment royalties.</p>
<p id="PO012-P020"><a href="#PO012-P020-R">(Added on 22 July 2010 see History)</a></p>
<p>21.  <em>India</em> does not agree with the interpretation in <a href="#CO012-P009.02">paragraph 9.2</a> of the Commentary on Article 12. It considers that a roaming call constitutes the use of a process. Accordingly, the payment made for the use of that process constitutes a royalty for the purposes of <a href="#A012">Article 12</a>. It is also the position of India that a payment for a roaming call constitutes a royalty since it is a payment for the use of industrial, commercial or scientific equipment.</p>

<p>22.  <em>India</em> does not agree with the interpretation in <a href="#CO012-P009.03">paragraph 9.3</a> of the Commentary on Article 12. It considers that a payment for spectrum license constitutes a royalty taxable both under India’s domestic law and its treaties with many countries.</p>

<p>23.  <em>Azerbaijan</em> and the <em>People’s Republic of China</em> do not adhere to the interpretation in <a href="#CO012-P010.01">paragraph 10.1</a>because they take the view that some payments for the exclusive distribution rights of a product or a service in a given territory may be treated as royalties.</p>
<p id="CHDCGFHH"><a href="#PO012-P023-R">(Amended on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>24.  <em>Bulgaria</em> does not adhere to the interpretation, given in <a href="#CO012-P014.04">paragraph 14.4</a> of the Commentary on Article 12, and is of the opinion that a distribution intermediary who distributes software to clients and with relation to these clients requests from the software copyright holder or from another person who has the right to copy the software, to provide software copies, irrespective whether on a tangible media or electronically, uses the copyright in the software product.</p>
