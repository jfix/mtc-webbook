<p id="PO007-P001.02"><a href="#PO007-P001.02-R">(Amended on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>1.3  Whilst the <em>People’s Republic of China</em> understands and respects the separate and independent enterprise principle underlying the new version of <a href="#A007">Article 7</a>, due to its tax administration capacity it reserves the right to adopt the previous version of the Article and, in some cases, to resort to simpler methods for calculating the profits attributable to a permanent establishment.</p>

<p id="PO007-ANNEX1">The following is the text of the non-OECD economies’ positions on Article 7 and its Commentary as it read before 22 July 2010.

<p id="">2.  <em>Malaysia</em>, <em>Thailand</em> and <em>Ukraine</em> reserve the right to add a provision to the effect that, if the information available to the competent authority of a Contracting State is inadequate to determine the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment of an enterprise, the competent authority may apply to that enterprise the provisions of the taxation law of that State, subject to the qualification that such law will be applied, so far as the information available to the competent authority permits, in accordance with the principles of this Article.</p>

<p id="">2.2  <em>Bulgaria</em> reserves the right to propose in bilateral negotiations the replacement, in this Article, of the term “profits” with the term “business profits”, provided that it is defined in Article 3.</p>

They will apply this rule only as a safeguard against abuse and not as a general “force of attraction principle”. Thus, the rule will not apply when the enterprise proves that the sales or activities have been carried out for reasons other than obtaining a benefit under the Convention.</p>
<p id="">4.  <em>Albania</em> and <em>Vietnam</em> reserve the right to tax in the State where the permanent establishment is situated business profits derived from the sale of goods or merchandise which are the same as or of a similar kind to the ones sold through a permanent establishment situated in that State or from other business activities carried on in that State of the same or similar kind as those effected through that permanent establishment.</p>

Furthermore, India also reserves the right to apply such a rule under Articles 11, 12, 13 and 21.</p>
<p id="">65  <em>Paragraph 3</em></p>
<p id="">5.  With respect to paragraph 3, <em>Argentina</em> reserves the right to provide that a Contracting State shall not be obliged to allow the deduction of expenses incurred abroad which are not reasonably attributable to the activity carried on by the permanent establishment, taking into account the general principles contained in domestic legislation concerning executive and administrative expenses for assistance services.</p>
<p id="">6.  <em>Brazil</em> reserves its position on the words “whether in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere” found in paragraph 3.</p>
