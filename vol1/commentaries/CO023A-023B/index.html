<h2 id="i-preliminary-remarks">I. Preliminary remarks<a class="headerlink" href="#i-preliminary-remarks" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p><title>The scope of the Articles</title>1.  These Articles deal with the so-called juridical double taxation where the same income or capital is taxable in the hands of the same person by more than one State.</p>
<p id="CO023A-023B-P001"><a href="#CO023A-023B-P001-R">(Amended on 11 April 1977 see History)</a></p>
<p>2.  This case has to be distinguished especially from the so-called economic double taxation,i.e.where two different persons are taxable in respect of the same income or capital. If two States wish to solve problems of economic double taxation, they must do so in bilateral negotiations.</p>
<p id="CO023A-023B-P002"><a href="#CO023A-023B-P002-R">(Amended on 11 April 1977 see History)</a></p>
<p>3.  International juridical double taxation may arise in three cases:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>where each Contracting State subjects the same person to tax on his worldwide income or capital (concurrent full liability to tax, see <a href="#CO023A-023B-P004">paragraph 4</a> below);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>where a person is a resident of a Contracting State (R)[^68] and derives income from, or owns capital in, the other Contracting State (S or E) and both States impose tax on that income or capital (see <a href="#CO023A-023B-P005">paragraph 5</a>below);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>where each Contracting State subjects the same person, not being a resident of either Contracting State to tax on income derived from, or capital owned in, a Contracting State; this may result, for instance, in the case where a non-resident person has a permanent establishment in one Contracting State (E) through which he derives income from, or owns capital in, the other Contracting State (S) (concurrent limited tax liability, see <a href="#CO023A-023B-P011">paragraph 11</a>below).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#CO023A-023B-P003-R">(Amended on 29 April 2000 see History)</a>4.  The conflict in case <em>a)</em> is reduced to that of case <em>b)</em> by virtue of <a href="#A004">Article 4</a>. This is because that Article defines the term “resident of a Contracting State” by reference to the liability to tax of a person under domestic law by reason of his domicile, residence, place of management or any other criterion of a similar nature (<a href="#A004-P001">paragraph 1</a> of Article 4) and by listing special criteria for the case of double residence to determine which of the two States is the State of residence (R) within the meaning of the Convention (paragraphs <a href="#A004-P002">2</a> and <a href="#A004-P003">3</a> of Article 4).</p>
<p id="CO023A-023B-P004"><a href="#CO023A-023B-P004-R">(Replaced on 11 April 1977 see History)</a></p>
<p>4.1  <a href="#A004">Article 4</a>, however, only deals with cases of concurrent full liability to tax. The conflict in case <em>a)</em> may therefore not be solved if the same item of income is subject to the full liability to tax of two countries but at different times. The following example illustrates that problem. Assume that a resident of State R1 derives a taxable benefit from an employee stock-option that is granted to that person. State R1 taxes that benefit when the option is granted. The person subsequently becomes a resident of State R2, which taxes the benefit at the time of its subsequent exercise. In that case, the person is taxed by each State at a time when he is a resident of that State and <a href="#A004">Article 4</a>does not deal with the issue as there is no concurrent residence in the two States.</p>
<p id="CO023A-023B-P004.01"><a href="#CO023A-023B-P004.01-R">(Added on 15 July 2005 see History)</a></p>
<p>4.2  The conflict in that situation will be reduced to that of case <em>b)</em>and solved accordingly to the extent that the employment services to which the option relates have been rendered in one of the Contracting States so as to be taxable by that State under <a href="#A015">Article 15</a> because it is the State where the relevant employment is exercised. Indeed, in such a case, the State in which the services have been rendered will be the State of source for purposes of elimination of double taxation by the other State. It does not matter that the first State does not levy tax at the same time (see <a href="#CO023A-023B-P032.08">paragraph 32.8</a>). It also does not matter that that State considers that it levies tax as a State of residence as opposed to a State of source (see the last sentence of <a href="#CO023A-023B-P008">paragraph 8</a>).</p>
<p id="CO023A-023B-P004.02"><a href="#CO023A-023B-P004.02-R">(Added on 15 July 2005 see History)</a></p>
<p>4.3  Where, however, the relevant employment services have not been rendered in either State, the conflict will not be one of source-residence double taxation. The mutual agreement procedure could be used to deal with such a case. One possible basis to solve the case would be for the competent authorities of the two States to agree that each State should provide relief as regards the residence-based tax that was levied by the other State on the part of the benefit that relates to services rendered during the period while the employee was a resident of that other State. Thus, in the above example, if the relevant services were rendered in a third State before the person became a resident of State R2, it would be logical for the competent authority of State R2 to agree to provide relief (either through the credit or exemption method) for the State R1 tax that has been levied on the part of the employment benefit that relates to services rendered in the third State since, at the time when these services were rendered, the taxpayer was a resident of State R1 and not of State R2 for purposes of the convention between these two States.</p>

<p>5.  The conflict in case <em>b)</em> may be solved by allocation of the right to tax between the Contracting States. Such allocation may be made by renunciation of the right to tax either by the State of source or situs (S) or of the situation of the permanent establishment (E), or by the State of residence (R), or by a sharing of the right to tax between the two States. The provisions of the Chapters III and IV of the Convention, combined with the provisions of Article <a href="#A023A">23 A</a> or <a href="#A023B">23 B</a>, govern such allocation.</p>
<p id="CO023A-023B-P005"><a href="#CO023A-023B-P005-R">(Amended on 29 April 2000 see History)</a></p>
<p>6.  For some items of income or capital, an exclusive right to tax is given to one of the Contracting States, and the relevant Article states that the income or capital in question “shall be taxable only” in a Contracting State.[^69] The words “shall be taxable only” in a Contracting State preclude the other Contracting State from taxing, thus double taxation is avoided. The State to which the exclusive right to tax is given is normally the State of which the taxpayer is a resident within the meaning of <a href="#A004">Article 4</a>, that is State R, but in four Articles[^70] the exclusive right may be given to the other Contracting State (S) of which the taxpayer is not a resident within the meaning of <a href="#A004">Article 4</a>.</p>
<p id="CO023A-023B-P006"><a href="#CO023A-023B-P006-R">(Amended on 17 July 2008 see History)</a></p>
<p>7.  For other items of income or capital, the attribution of the right to tax is not exclusive, and the relevant Article then states that the income or capital in question “may be taxed” in the Contracting State (S or E) of which the taxpayer is not a resident within the meaning of <a href="#A004">Article 4</a>. In such case the State of residence (R) must give relief so as to avoid the double taxation. Paragraphs <a href="#A023A-P001">1</a>and <a href="#A023A-P002">2</a> of Article 23 A and <a href="#A023B-P001">paragraph 1</a> of Article 23 B are designed to give the necessary relief.</p>
<p id="CO023A-023B-P007"><a href="#CO023A-023B-P007-R">(Replaced on 11 April 1977 see History)</a></p>
<p>8.  Articles <a href="#A023A">23 A</a> and <a href="#A023B">23 B</a> apply to the situation in which a resident of State R derives income from, or owns capital in, the other Contracting State E or S (not being the State of residence within the meaning of the Convention) and that such income or capital, in accordance with the Convention, may be taxed in such other State E or S. The Articles, therefore, apply only to the State of residence and do not prescribe how the other Contracting State E or S has to proceed.</p>
<p id="CO023A-023B-P008"><a href="#CO023A-023B-P008-R">(Replaced on 11 April 1977 see History)</a></p>
<p>9.  Where a resident of the Contracting State R derives income from the same State R through a permanent establishment which he has in the other Contracting State E, State E may tax such income (except income from immovable property situated in State R) if it is attributable to the said permanent establishment (<a href="#A021-P002">paragraph 2</a> of Article 21). In this instance too, State R must give relief under <a href="#A023A">Article 23 A</a> or <a href="#A023B">Article 23 B</a>for income attributable to the permanent establishment situated in State E, notwithstanding the fact that the income in question originally arises in State R (see <a href="#CO021-P005">paragraph 5</a> of the Commentary on Article 21). However, where the Contracting States agree to give to State R which applies the exemption method a limited right to tax as the State of source of dividends or interest within the limits fixed in <a href="#A010-P002">paragraph 2</a> of the Article 10 or <a href="#A011">11</a> (see <a href="#CO021-P005">paragraph 5</a> of the Commentary on Article 21), then the two States should also agree upon a credit to be given by State E for the tax levied by State R, along the lines of <a href="#A023A-P002">paragraph 2</a> of Article 23 A or of <a href="#A023B-P001">paragraph 1</a> of Article 23 B.</p>
<p id="CO023A-023B-P009"><a href="#CO023A-023B-P009-R">(Amended on 29 April 2000 see History)</a></p>
<p>10.  Where a resident of State R derives income from a third State through a permanent establishment which he has in State E, such State E may tax such income (except income from immovable property situated in the third State) if it is attributable to such permanent establishment (<a href="#A021-P002">paragraph 2</a> of Article 21). State R must give relief under <a href="#A023A">Article 23 A</a> or <a href="#A023B">Article 23 B</a> in respect of income attributable to the permanent establishment in State E. There is no provision in the Convention for relief to be given by Contracting State E for taxes levied in the third State where the income arises; however, under <a href="#A024-P003">paragraph 3</a> of Article 24 any relief provided for in the domestic laws of State E (double taxation conventions excluded) for residents of State E is also to be granted to a permanent establishment in State E of an enterprise of State R (see paragraphs <a href="#CO024-P067">67</a> to <a href="#CO024-P072">72</a> of the Commentary on Article 24).</p>

<p>11.  The conflict in case <em>c)</em> of <a href="#CO023A-023B-P003">paragraph 3</a> above is outside the scope of the Convention as, under <a href="#A001">Article 1</a>, it applies only to persons who are residents of one or both of the States. It can, however, be settled by applying the mutual agreement procedure (see also <a href="#CO023A-023B-P010">paragraph 10</a> above).</p>

<p><title>Description of methods for elimination of double taxation</title>12.  In the existing conventions, two leading principles are followed for the elimination of double taxation by the State of which the taxpayer is a resident. For purposes of simplicity, only income tax is referred to in what follows; but the principles apply equally to capital tax.</p>
<p id="CO023A-023B-P012"><a href="#CO023A-023B-P012-R">(Renumbered and amended on 11 April 1977 see History)</a></p>
<p><title>The principle of exemption</title>13.  Under the principle of exemption, the State of residence R does not tax the income which according to the Convention may be taxed in State E or S (nor, of course, also income which shall be taxable only in State E or S; see <a href="#CO023A-023B-P006">paragraph 6</a> above).</p>
<p id="CO023A-023B-P013"><a href="#CO023A-023B-P013-R">(Replaced on 11 April 1977 see History)</a></p>
<p>14.  The principle of exemption may be applied by two main methods:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>the income which may be taxed in State E or S is not taken into account at all by State R for the purposes of its tax; State R is not entitled to take the income so exempted into consideration when determining the tax to be imposed on the rest of the income; this method is called “full exemption”;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the income which may be taxed in State E or S is not taxed by State R, but State R retains the right to take that income into consideration when determining the tax to be imposed on the rest of the income; this method is called “exemption with progression”.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#CO023A-023B-P014-R">(Renumbered and amended on 11 April 1977 see History)</a><title>The principle of credit</title>15.  Under the principle of credit, the State of residence R calculates its tax on the basis of the taxpayer's total income including the income from the other State E or S which, according to the Convention, may be taxed in that other State (but not including income which shall be taxable only in State S; see <a href="#CO023A-023B-P006">paragraph 6</a>above). It then allows a deduction from its own tax for the tax paid in the other State.</p>
<p id="CO023A-023B-P015"><a href="#CO023A-023B-P015-R">(Renumbered and amended on 11 April 1977 see History)</a></p>
<p>16.  The principle of credit may be applied by two main methods:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>State R allows the deduction of the total amount of tax paid in the other State on income which may be taxed in that State, this method is called “full credit”;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the deduction given by State R for the tax paid in the other State is restricted to that part of its own tax which is appropriate to the income which may be taxed in the other State; this method is called “ordinary credit”.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#CO023A-023B-P016-R">(Renumbered and amended on 11 April 1977 see History)</a>17.  Fundamentally, the difference between the methods is that the exemption methods look at income, while the credit methods look at tax.</p>
<p id="CO023A-023B-P017"><a href="#CO023A-023B-P017-R">(Renumbered and amended on 11 April 1977 see History)</a></p>
<p><title>Operation and effects of the methods</title>18.  An example in figures will facilitate the explanation of the effects of the various methods. Suppose the total income to be 100,000, of which 80,000 is derived from one State (State of residence R) and 20,000 from the other State (State of source S). Assume that in State R the rate of tax on an income of 100,000 is 35 per cent and on an income of 80,000 is 30 per cent. Assume further that in State S the rate of tax is either 20 per cent — case (<em>i)</em> — or 40 per cent — case (<em>ii</em>) — so that the tax payable therein on 20,000 is 4,000 in case (<em>i)</em> or 8,000 in case <em>(ii),</em>respectively.</p>
<p id="CO023A-023B-P018"><a href="#CO023A-023B-P018-R">(Renumbered and amended on 11 April 1977 see History)</a></p>
<p>19.  If the taxpayer's total income of 100,000 arises in State R, his tax would be 35,000. If he had an income of the same amount, but derived in the manner set out above, and if no relief is provided for in the domestic laws of State R and no conventions exists between State R and State S, then the total amount of tax would be, in case (<em>i)</em>: 35,000 plus 4,000 = 39,000, and in case (<em>ii</em>): 35,000 plus 8,000 = 43,000.</p>
<p id="CO023A-023B-P019"><a href="#CO023A-023B-P019-R">(Renumbered and amended on 11 April 1977 see History)</a></p>
<p><title>Exemption methods</title>20.  Under the exemption methods, State R limits its taxation to that part of the total income which, in accordance with the various Articles of the Convention, it has a right to tax,i.e.80,000.<title>a) Full exemption</title></p>
<ol>

If the tax on the income from State S is lower in State S than the relief to be given by State R — cases <em>a (i)</em>, <em>a (ii)</em>, and <em>b (i)</em> — then the taxpayer will fare better than if his total income were derived solely from State R. In the converse case — case <em>b (ii)</em> — the taxpayer will be worse off.</p>

<p>22.  The example shows also that the relief given where State R applies the full exemption method may be higher than the tax levied in State S, even if the rates of tax in State S are higher than those in State R. This is due to the fact that under the full exemption method, not only the tax of State R on the income from State S is surrendered (35 per cent of 20,000 = 7,000; as under the exemption with progression), but that also the tax on remaining income (80,000) is reduced by an amount corresponding to the differences in rates at the two income levels in State R (35 less 30 = 5 per cent applied to 80,000 = 4,000).</p>

<p>25.  Where the tax due in State S is lower than the tax of State R appropriate to the income from State S (maximum deduction), the taxpayer will always have to pay the same amount of taxes as he would have had to pay if he were taxed only in State R,i.e.as if his total income were derived solely from State R.</p>

<p>27.  Where the tax due in State S is higher and where the credit is limited (ordinary credit), the taxpayer will not get a deduction for the whole of the tax paid in State S. In such event the result would be less favourable to the taxpayer than if his whole income arose in State R, and in these circumstances the ordinary credit method would have the same effect as the method of exemption with progression.</p>

<p><title>The methods proposed in the Articles</title>28.  In the conventions concluded between OECD member countries both leading principles have been followed. Some States have a preference for the first one, some for the other. Theoretically a single principle could be held to be more desirable, but, on account of the preferences referred to, each State has been left free to make its own choice.</p>
<p id="CO023A-023B-P028"><a href="#CO023A-023B-P028-R">(Renumbered and amended on 11 April 1977 see History)</a></p>
<p>29.  On the other hand, it has been found important to limit the number of methods based on each leading principle to be employed. In view of this limitation, the Articles have been drafted so that member countries are left free to choose between two methods:<itemizedlist></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the exemption method with progression (<a href="#A023A">Article 23 A</a>), and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the ordinary credit method (<a href="#A023B">Article 23 B</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></itemizedlist></p>
<p id="CO023A-023B-P029"><a href="#CO023A-023B-P029-R">(Renumbered and amended on 11 April 1977 see History)</a></p>
<p>30.  If two Contracting States both adopt the same method, it will be sufficient to insert the relevant Article in the convention. On the other hand, if the two Contracting States adopt different methods, both Articles may be amalgamated in one, and the name of the State must be inserted in each appropriate part of the Article, according to the method adopted by that State.</p>
<p id="CO023A-023B-P030"><a href="#CO023A-023B-P030-R">(Amended on 11 April 1977 see History)</a></p>
<p>31.  Contracting States may use a combination of the two methods. Such combination is indeed necessary for a Contracting State R which generally adopts the exemption method in the case of income which under Articles <a href="#A010">10</a> and <a href="#A011">11</a> may be subjected to a limited tax in the other Contracting State S. For such case, <a href="#A023A">Article 23 A</a> provides in <a href="#A023A-P002">paragraph 2</a> a credit for the limited tax levied in the other Contracting State S (adjustments to paragraphs <a href="#A023A-P001">1</a> and <a href="#A023A-P002">2</a> of Article 23 A may, however, be required in the case of distributions from Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) where provisions similar to those referred to in paragraphs <a href="#CO010-P067.01">67.1</a> to <a href="#CO010-P067.07">67.7</a> of the Commentary on Article 10 have been adopted by the Contracting States). Moreover, States which in general adopt the exemption method may wish to exclude specific items of income from exemption and to apply to such items the credit method. In such case, <a href="#A023A-P002">paragraph 2</a> of Article 23 A could be amended to include these items of income.</p>
<p id="CO023A-023B-P031"><a href="#CO023A-023B-P031-R">(Amended on 17 July 2008 see History)</a></p>
<p>31.1  One example where <a href="#A023A-P002">paragraph 2</a> could be so amended is where a State that generally adopts the exemption method considers that that method should not apply to items of income that benefit from a preferential tax treatment in the other State by reason of a tax measure that has been introduced in that State after the date of signature of the Convention. In order to include these items of income, <a href="#A023A-P002">paragraph 2</a> could be amended as follows:2.  Where a resident of a Contracting State derives an item of income which</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>in accordance with the provisions of Articles <a href="#A010">10</a> and <a href="#A011">11</a>, may be taxed in the other Contracting State, or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, may be taxed in the other Contracting State but which benefits from a preferential tax treatment in that other State by reason of a tax measure</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>that has been introduced in the other Contracting State after the date of signature of the Convention, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in respect of which that State has notified the competent authorities of the other Contracting State, before the item of income is so derived and after consultation with that other State, that this paragraph shall apply,</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>the first-mentioned State shall allow as a deduction from the tax on the income of that resident an amount equal to the tax paid in that other State. Such deduction shall not, however, exceed that part of the tax, as computed before the deduction is given, which is attributable to such item of income derived from that other State.</p>
<p id="CO023A-023B-P031.01"><a href="#CO023A-023B-P031.01-R">(Added on 28 January 2003 see History)</a></p>
<p>32.  The two Articles are drafted in a general way and do not give detailed rules on how the exemption or credit is to be computed, this being left to the domestic laws and practice applicable. Contracting States which find it necessary to settle any problem in the Convention itself are left free to do so in bilateral negotiations.</p>
<p id="CO023A-023B-P032"><a href="#CO023A-023B-P032-R">(Replaced on 11 April 1977 see History)</a></p>
<p><title>Conflicts of qualification</title>32.1  Both Articles <a href="#A023A">23 A</a> and <a href="#A023B">23 B</a>require that relief be granted, through the exemption or credit method, as the case may be, where an item of income or capital may be taxed by the State of source in accordance with the provisions of the Convention. Thus, the State of residence has the obligation to apply the exemption or credit method in relation to an item of income or capital where the Convention authorises taxation of that item by the State of source.</p>
<p id="CO023A-023B-P032.01"><a href="#CO023A-023B-P032.01-R">(Added on 29 April 2000 see History)</a></p>
<p>32.2  The interpretation of the phrase “in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, may be taxed”, which is used in both Articles, is particularly important when dealing with cases where the State of residence and the State of source classify the same item of income or capital differently for purposes of the provisions of the Convention.</p>
<p id="CO023A-023B-P032.02"><a href="#CO023A-023B-P032.02-R">(Added on 29 April 2000 see History)</a></p>
<p>32.3  Different situations need to be considered in that respect. Where, due to differences in the domestic law between the State of source and the State of residence, the former applies, with respect to a particular item of income or capital, provisions of the Convention that are different from those that the State of residence would have applied to the same item of income or capital, the income is still being taxed in accordance with the provisions of the Convention, as interpreted and applied by the State of source. In such a case, therefore, the two Articles require that relief from double taxation be granted by the State of residence notwithstanding the conflict of qualification resulting from these differences in domestic law.</p>
<p id="CO023A-023B-P032.03"><a href="#CO023A-023B-P032.03-R">(Added on 29 April 2000 see History)</a></p>
<p>32.4  This point may be illustrated by the following example. A business is carried on through a permanent establishment in State E by a partnership established in that State. A partner, resident in State R, alienates his interest in that partnership. State E treats the partnership as fiscally transparent whereas State R treats it as taxable entity. State E therefore considers that the alienation of the interest in the partnership is, for the purposes of its Convention with State R, an alienation by the partner of the underlying assets of the business carried on by the partnership, which may be taxed by that State in accordance with paragraph <a href="#A013-P001">1</a> or <a href="#A013-P002">2</a>of Article 13. State R, as it treats the partnership as a taxable entity, considers that the alienation of the interest in the partnership is akin to the alienation of a share in a company, which could not be taxed by State E by reason of <a href="#A013-P005">paragraph 5</a> of Article 13. In such a case, the conflict of qualification results exclusively from the different treatment of partnerships in the domestic laws of the two States and State E must be considered by State R to have taxed the gain from the alienation “in accordance with the provisions of the Convention” for purposes of the application of <a href="#A023A">Article 23 A</a> or <a href="#A023B">Article 23 B</a>. State R must therefore grant an exemption pursuant to <a href="#A023A">Article 23 A</a> or give a credit pursuant to <a href="#A023B">Article 23 B</a>irrespective of the fact that, under its own domestic law, it treats the alienation gain as income from the disposition of shares in a corporate entity and that, if State E's qualification of the income were consistent with that of State R, State R would not have to give relief under <a href="#A023A">Article 23 A</a> or <a href="#A023B">Article 23 B</a>. No double taxation will therefore arise in such a case.</p>
<p id="CO023A-023B-P032.04"><a href="#CO023A-023B-P032.04-R">(Amended on 28 January 2003 see History)</a></p>
<p>32.5  <a href="#A023A">Article 23 A</a> and <a href="#A023B">Article 23 B</a>, however, do not require that the State of residence eliminate double taxation in all cases where the State of source has imposed its tax by applying to an item of income a provision of the Convention that is different from that which the State of residence considers to be applicable. For instance, in the example above, if, for purposes of applying <a href="#A013-P002">paragraph 2</a> of Article 13, State E considers that the partnership carried on business through a fixed place of business but State R considers that <a href="#A013-P005">paragraph 5</a> applies because the partnership did not have a fixed place of business in State E, there is actually a dispute as to whether State E has taxed the income in accordance with the provisions of the Convention. The same may be said if State E, when applying <a href="#A013-P002">paragraph 2</a>of Article 13, interprets the phrase “forming part of the business property” so as to include certain assets which would not fall within the meaning of that phrase according to the interpretation given to it by State R. Such conflicts resulting from different interpretation of facts or different interpretation of the provisions of the Convention must be distinguished from the conflicts of qualification described in the above paragraph where the divergence is based not on different interpretations of the provisions of the Convention but on different provisions of domestic law. In the former case, State R can argue that State E has not imposed its tax in accordance with the provisions of the Convention if it has applied its tax based on what State R considers to be a wrong interpretation of the facts or a wrong interpretation of the Convention. States should use the provisions of <a href="#A025">Article 25</a> (Mutual Agreement Procedure), and in particular <a href="#A025-P003">paragraph 3</a> thereof, in order to resolve this type of conflict in cases that would otherwise result in unrelieved double taxation.</p>

<p>32.6  The phrase “in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, may be taxed” must also be interpreted in relation to possible cases of double non-taxation that can arise under <a href="#A023A">Article 23 A</a>. Where the State of source considers that the provisions of the Convention preclude it from taxing an item of income or capital which it would otherwise have had the right to tax, the State of residence should, for purposes of applying <a href="#A023A-P001">paragraph 1</a> of Article 23 A, consider that the item of income may not be taxed by the State of source in accordance with the provisions of the Convention, even though the State of residence would have applied the Convention differently so as to have the right to tax that income if it had been in the position of the State of source. Thus the State of residence is not required by <a href="#A023A-P001">paragraph 1</a> to exempt the item of income, a result which is consistent with the basic function of Article<a href="#A023A">XREFSTYLE=ArticleLabel23 only 23</a>which is to eliminate double taxation.</p>

<p>32.7  This situation may be illustrated by reference to a variation of the example described above. A business is carried on through a fixed place of business in State E by a partnership established in that State and a partner, resident in State R, alienates his interest in that partnership. Changing the facts of the example, however, it is now assumed that State E treats the partnership as a taxable entity whereas State R treats it as fiscally transparent; it is further assumed that State R is a State that applies the exemption method. State E, as it treats the partnership as a corporate entity, considers that the alienation of the interest in the partnership is akin to the alienation of a share in a company, which it cannot tax by reason of <a href="#A013-P005">paragraph 5</a> of Article 13. State R, on the other hand, considers that the alienation of the interest in the partnership should have been taxable by State E as an alienation by the partner of the underlying assets of the business carried on by the partnership to which paragraph <a href="#A013-P001">1</a> or <a href="#A013-P002">2</a>of Article 13 would have been applicable. In determining whether it has the obligation to exempt the income under <a href="#A023A-P001">paragraph 1</a> of Article 23 A, State R should nonetheless consider that, given the way that the provisions of the Convention apply in conjunction with the domestic law of State E, that State may not tax the income in accordance with the provisions of the Convention. State R is thus under no obligation to exempt the income.</p>

<p><title>Timing mismatch</title>32.8  The provisions of the Convention that allow the State of source to tax particular items of income or capital do not provide any restriction as to when such tax is to be levied (see, for instance, <a href="#CO015-P002.02">paragraph 2.2</a> of the Commentary on Article 15). Since both Articles <a href="#A023A">23 A</a> and <a href="#A023B">23 B</a> require that relief be granted where an item of income or capital may be taxed by the State of source in accordance with the provisions of the Convention, it follows that such relief must be provided regardless of when the tax is levied by the State of source. The State of residence must therefore provide relief of double taxation through the credit or exemption method with respect to such item of income or capital even though the State of source taxes it in an earlier or later year. Some States, however, do not follow the wording of <a href="#A023A">Article 23 A</a> or <a href="#A023B">23 B</a> in their bilateral conventions and link the relief of double taxation that they give under tax conventions to what is provided under their domestic laws. These countries, however, would be expected to seek other ways (the mutual agreement procedure, for example) to relieve the double taxation which might otherwise arise in cases where the State of source levies tax in a different taxation year.</p>

<p>34.  The State of residence must accordingly exempt income and capital which may be taxed by the other State in accordance with the Convention whether or not the right to tax is in effect exercised by that other State. This method is regarded as the most practical one since it relieves the State of residence from undertaking investigations of the actual taxation position in the other State.</p>

<p>34.1  The obligation imposed on the State of residence to exempt a particular item of income or capital depends on whether this item may be taxed by the State of source in accordance with the Convention. Paragraphs <a href="#CO023A-023B-P032.01">32.1</a> to <a href="#CO023A-023B-P032.07">32.7</a> above discuss how this condition should be interpreted. Where the condition is met, however, the obligation may be considered as absolute, subject to the exceptions of paragraphs <a href="#A023A-P002">2</a> and <a href="#A023A-P004">4</a> of Article 23 A. <a href="#A023A-P002">Paragraph 2</a> addresses the case, already mentioned in <a href="#CO023A-023B-P031">paragraph 31</a> above, of items of income which may only be subjected to a limited tax in the State of source. For such items of income, the paragraph provides for the credit method (see <a href="#CO023A-023B-P047">paragraph 47</a> below). <a href="#A023A-P004">Paragraph 4</a> addresses the case of certain conflicts of qualification which would result in double non-taxation as a consequence of the application of the Convention if the State of residence were obliged to give exemption (see paragraphs <a href="#CO023A-023B-P056.01">56.1</a> to <a href="#CO023A-023B-P056.03">56.3</a> below).</p>

<p>35.  Occasionally, negotiating States may find it reasonable in certain circumstances, in order to avoid double non-taxation, to make an exception to the absolute obligation on the State of residence to give exemption in cases where neither <a href="#A023A-P003">paragraph 3</a> or <a href="#A023A-P004">4</a> would apply. Such may be the case where no tax on specific items of income or capital is provided under the domestic laws of the State of source, or tax is not effectively collected owing to special circumstances such as the set-off of losses, a mistake, or the statutory time limit having expired. To avoid such double non-taxation of specific items of income, Contracting States may agree to amend the relevant Article itself (see <a href="#CO015-P009">paragraph 9</a> of the Commentary on Article 15 and <a href="#CO017-P012">paragraph 12</a> of the Commentary on Article 17; for the converse case where relief in the State of source is subject to actual taxation in the State of residence, see <a href="#CO010-P020">paragraph 20</a> of the Commentary on Article 10, <a href="#CO011-P010">paragraph 10</a> of the Commentary on Article 11, <a href="#CO012-P006">paragraph 6</a> of the Commentary on Article 12, <a href="#CO013-P021">paragraph 21</a> of the Commentary on Article 13 and <a href="#CO021-P003">paragraph 3</a> of the Commentary on Article 21). One might also make an exception to the general rule, in order to achieve a certain reciprocity, where one of the States adopts the exemption method and the other the credit method. Finally, another exception to the general rule may be made where a State wishes to apply to specific items of income the credit method rather than exemption (see <a href="#CO023A-023B-P031">paragraph 31</a> above).</p>

<p id=""><title>Alternative formulation of the Article</title>37.  An effect of the exemption method as it is drafted in the Article is that the taxable income or capital in the State of residence is reduced by the amount exempted in that State. If in a particular State the amount of income as determined for income tax purposes is used as a measure for other purposes,e.g.social benefits, the application of the exemption method in the form proposed may have the effect that such benefits may be given to persons who ought not to receive them. To avoid such consequences, the Article may be altered so that the income in question is included in the taxable income in the State of residence. The State of residence must, in such cases, give up that part of the total tax appropriate to the income concerned. This procedure would give the same result as the Article in the form proposed. States can be left free to make such modifications in the drafting of the Article. If a State wants to draft the Article as indicated above, <a href="#A023A-P001">paragraph 1</a> may be drafted as follows:Where a resident of a Contracting State derives income or owns capital which, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, shall be taxable only or may be taxed in the other Contracting State, the first-mentioned State shall, subject to the provisions of <a href="#A023A-P002">paragraph 2</a>, allow as a deduction from the income tax or capital tax that part of the income tax or capital tax, respectively, which is applicable, as the case may be, to the income derived from or the capital owned in that other State.</p>
<p>If the Article is so drafted, <a href="#A023A-P003">paragraph 3</a> would not be necessary and could be omitted.</p>

<p><title>Miscellaneous problems</title>38.  <a href="#A023A">Article 23 A</a> contains the principle that the State of residence has to give exemption, but does not give detailed rules on how the exemption has to be implemented. This is consistent with the general pattern of the Convention. Articles <a href="#A006">6</a> to <a href="#A022">22</a> too lay down rules attributing the right to tax in respect of the various types of income or capital without dealing, as a rule, with the determination of taxable income or capital, deductions, rate of tax, etc. (see, however, <a href="#A024">Article 24</a>). Experience has shown that many problems may arise. This is especially true with respect to <a href="#A023A">Article 23 A</a>. Some of them are dealt with in the following paragraphs. In the absence of a specific provision in the Convention, the domestic laws of each Contracting State are applicable. Some conventions contain an express reference to the domestic laws but of course this would not help where the exemption method is not used in the domestic laws. In such cases, Contracting States which face this problem should establish rules for the application of <a href="#A023A">Article 23 A</a>, if necessary, after having consulted with the competent authority of the other Contracting State (<a href="#A025-P003">paragraph 3</a> of Article 25).</p>

<p><title>Amount to be exempted</title>39.  The amount of income to be exempted from tax by the State of residence is the amount which, but for the Convention, would be subjected to domestic income tax according to the domestic laws governing such tax. It may, therefore, differ from the amount of income subjected to tax by the State of source according to its domestic laws.</p>
<p id="CO023A-023B-P039"><a href="#CO023A-023B-P039-R">(Replaced on 11 April 1977 see History)</a></p>
<p>40.  Normally, the basis for the calculation of income tax is the total net income,i.e.gross income less allowable deductions. Therefore, it is the gross income derived from the State of source less any allowable deductions (specified or proportional) connected with such income which is to be exempted.</p>

<p>41.  Problems arise from the fact that most countries provide in their respective taxation laws for additional deductions from total income or specific items of income to arrive at the income subject to tax. A numerical example may illustrate the problem:</p>

<p>The question is, what amount should be exempted from tax,e.g.<itemizedlist></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>100 (line <em>b)</em>, leaving a taxable amount of 50;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>90 (half of line <em>e</em>, according to the ratio between line <em>b</em> and line <em>c)</em>, leaving 60 (line <em>f</em> being fully deducted from domestic income);</p>

<p>42.  A comparison of the laws and practices of the OECD member countries shows that the amount to be exempted varies considerably from country to country. The solution adopted by a State will depend on the policy followed by that State and its tax structure. It may be the intention of a State that its residents always enjoy the full benefit of their personal and family allowances and other deductions. In other States these tax free amounts are apportioned. In many States personal or family allowances form part of the progressive scale, are granted as a deduction from tax, or are even unknown, the family status being taken into account by separate tax scales.</p>

<p>43.  In view of the wide variety of fiscal policies and techniques in the different States regarding the determination of tax, especially deductions, allowances and similar benefits, it is preferable not to propose an express and uniform solution in the Convention, but to leave each State free to apply its own legislation and technique. Contracting States which prefer to have special problems solved in their convention are, of course, free to do so in bilateral negotiations. Finally, attention is drawn to the fact that the problem is also of importance for States applying the credit method (see <a href="#CO023A-023B-P062">paragraph 62</a> below).</p>

<p><title>Treatment of losses</title>44.  Several States in applying <a href="#A023A">Article 23 A</a> treat losses incurred in the other State in the same manner as they treat income arising in that State: as State of residence (State R), they do not allow deduction of a loss incurred from immovable property or a permanent establishment situated in the other State (E or S). Provided that this other State allows carry-over of such loss, the taxpayer will not be at any disadvantage as he is merely prevented from claiming a double deduction of the same loss namely in State E (or S) and in State R. Other States may, as State of residence R, allow a loss incurred in State E (or S) as a deduction from the income they assess. In such a case State R should be free to restrict the exemption under <a href="#A023A-P001">paragraph 1</a> of <a href="#A023A">Article 23 A</a> for profits or income which are made subsequently in the other State E (or S) by deducting from such subsequent profits or income the amount of earlier losses which the taxpayer can carry over in State E (or S). As the solution depends primarily on the domestic laws of the Contracting States and as the laws of the OECD member countries differ from each other substantially, no solution can be proposed in the Article itself, it being left to the Contracting States, if they find it necessary, to clarify the above-mentioned question and other problems connected with losses (see <a href="#CO023A-023B-P062">paragraph 62</a>below for the credit method) bilaterally, either in the Article itself or by way of a mutual agreement procedure (<a href="#A025-P003">paragraph 3</a> of Article 25).</p>

<p><title>Taxation of the rest of the income</title>45.  Apart from the application of progressive tax rates which is now dealt with in <a href="#A025-P003">paragraph 3</a> of the Article (see paragraphs <a href="#CO023A-023B-P055">55</a> and <a href="#CO023A-023B-P056">56</a> below), some problems may arise from specific provisions of the tax laws. Thus,e.g.some tax laws provide that taxation starts only if a minimum amount of taxable income is reached or exceeded (tax exempt threshold). Total income before application of the Convention may clearly exceed such tax free threshold, but by virtue of the exemption resulting from the application of the Convention which leads to a deduction of the tax exempt income from total taxable income, the remaining taxable income may be reduced to an amount below this threshold. For the reasons mentioned in <a href="#CO023A-023B-P043">paragraph 43</a> above, no uniform solution can be proposed. It may be noted, however, that the problem will not arise, if the alternative formulation of paragraph 1 of Article 23 A (as set out in <a href="#CO023A-023B-P037">paragraph 37</a> above) is adopted.</p>

<p>46.  Certain States have introduced special systems for taxing corporate income (see paragraphs <a href="#CO010-P040">40</a> to <a href="#CO010-P067">67</a> of the Commentary on Article 10). In States applying a split rate corporation tax (<a href="#CO010-P043">paragraph 43</a> of the said Commentary), the problem may arise whether the income to be exempted has to be deducted from undistributed income (to which the normal rate of tax applies) or from distributed income (to which the reduced rate applies) or whether the income to be exempted has to be attributed partly to distributed and partly to undistributed income. Where, under the laws of a State applying the split rate corporation tax, a supplementary tax is levied in the hands of a parent company on dividends which it received from a domestic subsidiary company but which it does not redistribute (on the grounds that such supplementary tax is a compensation for the benefit of a lower tax rate granted to the subsidiary on the distributions), the problem arises, whether such supplementary tax may be charged where the subsidiary pays its dividends out of income exempt from tax by virtue of the Convention. Finally a similar problem may arise in connection with taxes (précompte, Advance Corporation Tax) which are levied on distributed profits of a corporation in order to cover the tax credit attributable to the shareholders (see <a href="#CO010-P047">paragraph 47</a> of the Commentary on Article 10). The question is whether such special taxes connected with the distribution of profits, could be levied insofar as distributions are made out of profits exempt from tax. It is left to Contracting States to settle these questions by bilateral negotiations.</p>

<p></paragraphsection><paragraphsection><title>Paragraph 2</title>47.  In Articles <a href="#A010">10</a> and <a href="#A011">11</a> the right to tax dividends and interest is divided between the State of residence and the State of source. In these cases, the State of residence is left free not to tax if it wants to do so (seee.g.paragraphs <a href="#CO023A-023B-P072">72</a> to <a href="#CO023A-023B-P078">78</a> below) and to apply the exemption method also to the above-mentioned items of income. However, where the State of residence prefers to make use of its right to tax such items of income, it cannot apply the exemption method to eliminate the double taxation since it would thus give up fully its right to tax the income concerned. For the State of residence, the application of the credit method would normally seem to give a satisfactory solution. Moreover, as already indicated in <a href="#CO023A-023B-P031">paragraph 31</a> above, States which in general apply the exemption method may wish to apply to specific items of income the credit method rather than exemption. Consequently, the paragraph is drafted in accordance with the ordinary credit method. The Commentary on Article 23 B hereafter appliesmutatis mutandisto <a href="#A023A-P002">paragraph 2</a> of Article 23 A.</p>

<p>48.  In the cases referred to in the previous paragraph, certain maximum percentages are laid down for tax reserved to the State of source. In such cases, the rate of tax in the State of residence will very often be higher than the rate in the State of source. The limitation of the deduction which is laid down in the second sentence of <a href="#A023A-P002">paragraph 2</a> and which is in accordance with the ordinary credit method is therefore of consequence only in a limited number of cases. If, in such cases, the Contracting States prefer to waive the limitation and to apply the full credit method, they can do so by deleting the second sentence of <a href="#A023A-P002">paragraph 2</a>.</p>

<p><title>Dividends from substantial holdings by a company</title>49.  The combined effect of paragraphs <a href="#A010-P001">1</a> and <a href="#A010-P002">2</a> of Article 10 and <a href="#A023A">Article#160;23</a> (<a href="#A023A">Article 23 A</a> or <a href="#A023B">23 B</a> as appropriate) is that the State of residence of the shareholder is allowed to tax dividends arising in the other State, but that it must credit against its own tax on such dividends the tax which has been collected by the State where the dividends arise at a rate fixed under <a href="#A010-P002">paragraph 2</a> of Article 10. This regime equally applies when the recipient of the dividends is a parent company receiving dividends from a subsidiary; in this case, the tax withheld in the State of the subsidiary — and credited in the State of the parent company — is limited to 5 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends by the application of subparagraph <em>a)</em> of <a href="#A010-P002">paragraph 2</a> of Article 10.</p>
<p id="CO023A-023B-P049"><a href="#CO023A-023B-P049-R">(Replaced on 11 April 1977 see History)</a></p>
<p>50.  These provisions effectively avoid the juridical double taxation of dividends but they do not prevent recurrent corporate taxation on the profits distributed to the parent company: first at the level of the subsidiary and again at the level of the parent company. Such recurrent taxation creates a very important obstacle to the development of international investment. Many States have recognised this and have inserted in their domestic laws provisions designed to avoid this obstacle. Moreover, provisions to this end are frequently inserted in double taxation conventions.</p>

<p>51.  The Committee on Fiscal Affairs has considered whether it would be appropriate to modify <a href="#A023A">Article#160;23</a> of the Convention in order to settle this question. Although many States favoured the insertion of such a provision in the Model Convention this met with many difficulties, resulting from the diverse opinions of States and the variety of possible solutions. Some States, fearing tax evasion, preferred to maintain their freedom of action and to settle the question only in their domestic laws.</p>

<p>52.  In the end, it appeared preferable to leave States free to choose their own solution to the problem. For States preferring to solve the problem in their conventions, the solutions would most frequently follow one of the principles below:<title><em>Exemption with progression</em></title></p>
<ol>
<li>The State of which the parent company is a resident exempts the dividends it receives from its subsidiary in the other State, but it may nevertheless take these dividends into account in computing the tax due by the parent company on the remaining income (such a provision will frequently be favoured by States applying the exemption method specified in <a href="#A023A">Article 23 A</a>).</li>
</ol>
<p><title><em>Credit for underlying taxes</em></title>
1. As regards dividends received from the subsidiary, the State of which the parent company is a resident gives credit as provided for in <a href="#A023A-P002">paragraph 2</a> of Article 23 A or in <a href="#A023B-P001">paragraph 1</a> of Article 23 B, as appropriate, not only for the tax on dividends as such, but also for the tax paid by the subsidiary on the profits distributed (such a provision will frequently be favoured by States applying as a general rule the credit method specified in <a href="#A023B">Article 23 B</a>).</p>
<p><title><em>Assimilation to a holding in a domestic subsidiary</em></title>
1. The dividends that the parent company derives from a foreign subsidiary are treated, in the State of the parent company, in the same way for tax purposes as dividends received from a subsidiary which is a resident of that State.</p>
<p><a href="#CO023A-023B-P052-R">(Replaced on 11 April 1977 see History)</a>53.  When the State of the parent company levies taxes on capital, a similar solution should also be applied to such taxes.</p>

<p>54.  Moreover, States are free to fix the limits and methods of application of these provisions (definition and minimum duration of holding of the shares, proportion of the dividends deemed to be taken up by administrative or financial expenses) or to make the relief granted under the special regime subject to the condition that the subsidiary is carrying out a genuine economic activity in the State of which it is a resident, or that it derives the major part of its income from that State or that it is subject to a substantial taxation on profits therein.</p>

<p></paragraphsection><paragraphsection><title>Paragraph 3</title>55.  The 1963 Draft Convention reserved expressly the application of the progressive scale of tax rates by the State of residence (last sentence of paragraph 1 of Article 23 A) and most conventions concluded between OECD member countries which adopt the exemption method follow this principle. According to <a href="#A023A-P003">paragraph 3</a> of Article 23 A, the State of residence retains the right to take the amount of exempted income or capital into consideration when determining the tax to be imposed on the rest of the income or capital. The rule applies even where the exempted income (or items of capital) and the taxable income (or items of capital) accrue to those persons (e.g.husband and wife) whose incomes (or items of capital) are taxed jointly according to the domestic laws. This principle of progression applies to income or capital exempted by virtue of <a href="#A023A-P001">paragraph 1</a> of Article 23 A as well as to income or capital which under any other provision of the Convention “shall be taxable only” in the other Contracting State (see paragraph 6 above). This is the reason why, in the 1977 Model Convention, the principle of progression was transferred from <a href="#A023A-P001">paragraph 1</a> of Article 23 A to a new <a href="#A023A-P003">paragraph 3</a> of the said Article, and reference was made to exemption “in accordance with any provision of the Convention”.</p>

<p>56.  <a href="#A023A-P003">Paragraph 3</a> of Article 23 A relates only to the State of residence. The form of the Article does not prejudice the application by the State of source of the provisions of its domestic laws concerning the progression.</p>

<p></paragraphsection><paragraphsection><title>Paragraph 4</title>56.1  The purpose of this paragraph is to avoid double non taxation as a result of disagreements between the State of residence and the State of source on the facts of a case or on the interpretation of the provisions of the Convention. The paragraph applies where, on the one hand, the State of source interprets the facts of a case or the provisions of the Convention in such a way that an item of income or capital falls under a provision of the Convention that eliminates its right to tax that item or limits the tax that it can impose while, on the other hand, the State of residence adopts a different interpretation of the facts or of the provisions of the Convention and thus considers that the item may be taxed in the State of source in accordance with the Convention, which, absent this paragraph, would lead to an obligation for the State of residence to give exemption under the provisions of <a href="#A023A-P001">paragraph 1</a>.</p>

<p>56.2  The paragraph only applies to the extent that the State of source has applied the provisions of the Convention to exempt an item of income or capital or has applied the provisions of <a href="#A010-P002">paragraph 2</a> of Article 10 or <a href="#A011">11</a> to an item of income. The paragraph would therefore not apply where the State of source considers that it may tax an item of income or capital in accordance with the provisions of the Convention but where no tax is actually payable on such income or capital under the provisions of the domestic laws of the State of source. In such a case, the State of residence must exempt that item of income under the provisions of <a href="#A023A-P001">paragraph 1</a> because the exemption in the State of source does not result from the application of the provisions of the Convention but, rather, from the domestic law of the State of source (see <a href="#CO023A-023B-P034">paragraph 34</a> above). Similarly, where the source and residence States disagree not only with respect to the qualification of the income but also with respect to the amount of such income, <a href="#A023A-P004">paragraph 4</a> applies only to that part of the income that the State of source exempts from tax through the application of the Convention or to which that State applies <a href="#A010-P002">paragraph 2</a> of Article 10 or <a href="#A011">11</a>.</p>

<p>56.3  Cases where the paragraph applies must be distinguished from cases where the qualification of an item of income under the domestic law of the State of source interacts with the provisions of the Convention to preclude that State from taxing an item of income or capital in circumstances where the qualification of that item under the domestic law of the State of residence would not have had the same result. In such a case, which is discussed in <a href="#CO023A-023B-P032.06">XREFSTYLE=ParaLabel Plural</a> and <a href="#CO023A-023B-P032.07">32.7</a> above, <a href="#A023A-P001">paragraph 1</a> does not impose an obligation on the State of residence to give exemption because the item of income may not be taxed in the State of source in accordance with the Convention. Since <a href="#A023A-P001">paragraph 1</a> does not apply, the provisions of <a href="#A023A-P004">paragraph 4</a>are not required in such a case to ensure the taxation right of the State of residence.</p>

<p></paragraphsection>## III. Commentary on the provisions of Article 23 B (credit method)</p>
<p><paragraphsection><title>Paragraph 1</title><title>Methods</title>57.  <a href="#A023B">Article 23 B</a>, based on the credit principle, follows the ordinary credit method: the State of residence (R) allows, as a deduction from its own tax on the income or capital of its resident, an amount equal to the tax paid in the other State E (or S) on the income derived from, or capital owned in, that other State E (or S), but the deduction is restricted to the appropriate proportion of its own tax.</p>
<p id="CO023A-023B-P057"><a href="#CO023A-023B-P057-R">(Renumbered and amended on 11 April 1977 see History)</a></p>
<p>58.  The ordinary credit method is intended to apply also for a State which follows the exemption method but has to give credit, under <a href="#A023B-P002">paragraph 2</a> of Article 23 A, for the tax levied at limited rates in the other State on dividends and interest (see <a href="#CO023A-023B-P047">paragraph 47</a> above). The possibility of some modification as mentioned in paragraphs <a href="#CO023A-023B-P047">47</a> and <a href="#CO023A-023B-P048">48</a> above (full credit) could, of course, also be of relevance in the case of dividends and interest paid to a resident of a State which adopted the ordinary credit method (see also <a href="#CO023A-023B-P063">paragraph 63</a> below).</p>
<p id="CO023A-023B-P058"><a href="#CO023A-023B-P058-R">(Renumbered and amended on 11 April 1977 see History)</a></p>
<p>59.  The obligation imposed by <a href="#A023B">Article 23 B</a> on a State R to give credit for the tax levied in the other State E (or S) on an item of income or capital depends on whether this item may be taxed by the State E (or S) in accordance with the Convention. Paragraphs <a href="#CO023A-023B-P032.01">32.1</a> to <a href="#CO023A-023B-P032.07">32.7</a> above discuss how this condition should be interpreted. Items of income or capital which according to <a href="#A008">Article 8</a>, to <a href="#A013-P003">paragraph 3</a> of Article 13, to subparagraph <em>a)</em> of paragraphs <a href="#A019-P001">1</a> and <a href="#A019-P002">2</a> of Article 19 and to <a href="#A022-P003">paragraph 3</a> of Article 22, “shall be taxable only” in the other State, are from the outset exempt from tax in State R (see <a href="#CO023A-023B-P006">paragraph 6</a> above), and the Commentary on <a href="#A023A">Article 23 A</a> applies to such exempted income and capital. As regards progression, reference is made to <a href="#A023A-P002">paragraph 2</a> of the Article (and <a href="#CO023A-023B-P079">paragraph 79</a> below).</p>
<p id="CO023A-023B-P059"><a href="#CO023A-023B-P059-R">(Amended on 29 April 2000 see History)</a></p>
<p>60.  <a href="#A023B">Article 23 B</a> sets out the main rules of the credit method, but does not give detailed rules on the computation and operation of the credit. This is consistent with the general pattern of the Convention. Experience has shown that many problems may arise. Some of them are dealt with in the following paragraphs. In many States, detailed rules on credit for foreign tax already exist in their domestic laws. A number of conventions, therefore, contain a reference to the domestic laws of the Contracting States and further provide that such domestic rules shall not affect the principle laid down in <a href="#A023B">Article 23 B</a>. Where the credit method is not used in the domestic laws of a Contracting State, this State should establish rules for the application of <a href="#A023B">Article 23 B</a>, if necessary after consultation with the competent authority of the other Contracting State (<a href="#A025-P003">paragraph 3</a> of Article 25).</p>
<p id="CO023A-023B-P060"><a href="#CO023A-023B-P060-R">(Added on 11 April 1977 see History)</a></p>
<p>61.  The amount of foreign tax for which a credit has to be allowed is the tax effectively paid in accordance with the Convention in the other Contracting State. Problems may arise,e.g.where such tax is not calculated on the income of the year for which it is levied but on the income of a preceding year or on the average income of two of more preceding years. Other problems may arise in connection with different methods of determining the income or in connection with changes in the currency rates (devaluation or revaluation). However, such problems could hardly be solved by an express provision in the Convention.</p>
<p id="CO023A-023B-P061"><a href="#CO023A-023B-P061-R">(Added on 11 April 1977 see History)</a></p>
<p>62.  According to the provisions of the second sentence of <a href="#A023B-P001">paragraph 1</a>of Article 23 B, the deduction which the State of residence (R) is to allow is restricted to that part of the income tax which is appropriate to the income derived from the State S, or E (so-called “maximum deduction”). Such maximum deduction may be computed either by apportioning the total tax on total income according to the ratio between the income for which credit is to be given and the total income, or by applying the tax rate for total income to the income for which credit is to be given. In fact, in cases where the tax in State E (or S) equals or exceeds the appropriate tax of State R, the credit method will have the same effect as the exemption method with progression. Also under the credit method, similar problems as regards the amount of income, tax rate, etc. may arise as are mentioned in the Commentary on <a href="#A023A">Article 23 A</a> (see especially paragraphs <a href="#CO023A-023B-P039">39</a> to <a href="#CO023A-023B-P041">41</a> and <a href="#CO023A-023B-P044">44</a> above). For the same reasons mentioned in paragraphs <a href="#CO023A-023B-P042">42</a> and <a href="#CO023A-023B-P043">43</a> above, it is preferable also for the credit method not to propose an express and uniform solution in the Convention, but to leave each State free to apply its own legislation and technique. This is also true for some further problems which are dealt with below.</p>
<p id="CO023A-023B-P062"><a href="#CO023A-023B-P062-R">(Added on 11 April 1977 see History)</a></p>
<p>63.  The maximum deduction is normally computed as the tax on net income,i.e.on the income from State E (or S) less allowable deductions (specified or proportional) connected with such income (see <a href="#CO023A-023B-P040">paragraph 40</a> above). For such reason, the maximum deduction in many cases may be lower than the tax effectively paid in State E (or S). This may especially be true in the case where, for instance, a resident of State R deriving interest from State S has borrowed funds from a third person to finance the interest-producing loan. As the interest due on such borrowed money may be offset against the interest derived from State S, the amount of net income subject to tax in State R may be very small, or there may even be no net income at all. As explained in <a href="#CO011-P007.01">paragraph 7.1</a> of the Commentary on Article 11, the problem, in that case, cannot be solved by State R, since little or no tax will be levied in that State. One solution would be to exempt such interest from tax in State S, as is proposed in paragraphs <a href="#CO011-P007">7</a> to <a href="#CO011-P007.12">7.12</a> of the Commentary on Article 11.</p>
<p id="CO023A-023B-P063"><a href="#CO023A-023B-P063-R">(Amended on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>64.  If a resident of State R derives income of different kinds from State S, and the latter State, according to its tax laws imposes tax only on one of these items, the maximum deduction which State R is to allow will normally be that part of its tax which is appropriate only to that item of income which is taxed in State S. However, other solutions are possible, especially in view of the following broader problem: the fact that credit has to be given,e.g.for several items of income on which tax at different rates is levied in State S, or for income from several States, with or without conventions, raises the question whether the maximum deduction or the credit has to be calculated separately for each item of income, or for each country, or for all foreign income qualifying for credit under domestic laws and under conventions. Under an “overall credit” system, all foreign income is aggregated, and the total of foreign taxes is credited against the domestic tax appropriate to the total foreign income.</p>
<p id="CO023A-023B-P064"><a href="#CO023A-023B-P064-R">(Added on 11 April 1977 see History)</a></p>
<p>65.  Further problems may arise in case of losses. A resident of State R, deriving income from State E (or S), may have a loss in State R, or in State E (or S) or in a third State. For purposes of the tax credit, in general, a loss in a given State will be set off against other income from the same State. Whether a loss suffered outside State R (e.g.in a permanent establishment) may be deducted from other income, whether derived from State R or not depends on the domestic laws of State R. Here similar problems may arise, as mentioned in the Commentary on <a href="#A023A">Article 23 A</a> (<a href="#CO023A-023B-P044">paragraph 44</a> above). When the total income is derived from abroad, and no income but a loss not exceeding the income from abroad arises in State R, then the total tax charged in State R will be appropriate to the income from State S, and the maximum deduction which State R is to allow will consequently be the tax charged in State R. Other solutions are possible.</p>
<p id="CO023A-023B-P065"><a href="#CO023A-023B-P065-R">(Added on 11 April 1977 see History)</a></p>
<p>66.  The aforementioned problems depend very much on domestic laws and practice, and the solution must, therefore, be left to each State. In this context, it may be noted that some States are very liberal in applying the credit method. Some States are also considering or have already adopted the possibility of carrying over unused tax credits. Contracting States are, of course, free in bilateral negotiations to amend the Article to deal with any of the aforementioned problems.</p>

<p>67.  In so-called “thin capitalisation” situations, the Model Convention allows the State of the borrower company, under certain conditions, to treat an interest payment as a distribution of dividends in accordance with its domestic legislation; the essential condition is that the contributor of the loan should effectively share the risks run by the borrower company. This gives rise to two consequences:<itemizedlist></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the taxing at source of such “interest” at the rate for dividends (<a href="#A010-P002">paragraph 2</a> of Article 10);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the inclusion of such “interest” in the taxable profits of the lender company.</p>

<p id="CO023A-023B-P067"><a href="#CO023A-023B-P067-R">(Replaced on 23 July 1992 see History)</a></p>
<p>68.  If the relevant conditions are met, the State of residence of the lender would be obliged to give relief for any juridical or economic double taxation of the interest as if the payment was in fact a dividend. It should then give credit for tax effectively withheld on this interest in the State of residence of the borrower at the rate applicable to dividends and, in addition, if the lender is the parent company of the borrower company, apply to such “interest” any additional relief under its parent/subsidiary regime. This obligation may result:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>from the actual wording of <a href="#A023A">Article#160;23</a> of the Convention, when it grants relief in respect of income defined as dividends in <a href="#A010">Article 10</a> or of items of income dealt with in <a href="#A010">Article 10</a>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from the context of the Convention,i.e.from a combination of Articles <a href="#A009">9</a>, <a href="#A010">10</a>, <a href="#A011">11</a>, and<a href="#A023A">XREFSTYLE=ArticleLabel23 only 23</a> and if need be, by way of the mutual agreement procedure:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><itemizedlist></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>where the interest has been treated in the country of residence of the borrower company as a dividend under rules which are in accordance with <a href="#A009-P001">paragraph 1</a> of Article 9 or <a href="#A011-P006">paragraph 6</a> of Article 11 and where the State of residence of the lender agrees that it has been properly so treated and is prepared to apply a corresponding adjustment;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when the State of residence of the lender applies similar thin capitalisation rules and would treat the payment as a dividend in a reciprocal situation,i.e.if the payment were made by a company established in its territory to a resident in the other Contracting State;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in all other cases where the State of residence of the lender recognises that it was proper for the State of residence of the borrower to treat the interest as a dividend.</p>

<p>69.1  Problems may arise where Contracting States treat entities such as partnerships in a different way. Assume, for example, that the State of source treats a partnership as a company and the State of residence of a partner treats it as fiscally transparent. The State of source may, subject to the applicable provisions of the Convention, tax the partnership on its income when that income is realised and, subject to the limitations of <a href="#A010-P002">paragraph 2</a> of Article 10, may also tax the distribution of profits by the partnership to its non-resident partners. The State of residence, however, will only tax the partner on his share of the partnership’s income when that income is realised by the partnership.</p>

<p>69.2  The first issue that arises in this case is whether the State of residence, which taxes the partner on his share in the partnership’s income, is obliged, under the Convention, to give credit for the tax that is levied in the State of source on the partnership, which that latter State treats as a separate taxable entity. The answer to that question must be affirmative. To the extent that the State of residence flows through the income of the partnership to the partner for the purpose of taxing him, it must adopt a coherent approach and flow through to the partner the tax paid by the partnership for the purposes of eliminating double taxation arising from its taxation of the partner. In other words, if the corporate status given to the partnership by the State of source is ignored by the State of residence for purposes of taxing the partner on his share of the income, it should likewise be ignored for purposes of the foreign tax credit.</p>

<p>69.3  A second issue that arises in this case is the extent to which the State of residence must provide credit for the tax levied by the State of source on the distribution, which is not taxed in the State of residence. The answer to that question lies in that last fact. Since the distribution is not taxed in the State of residence, there is simply no tax in the State of residence against which to credit the tax levied by the State of source upon the distribution. A clear distinction must be made between the generation of profits and the distribution of those profits and the State of residence should not be expected to credit the tax levied by the State of source upon the distribution against its own tax levied upon generation (see the first sentence of <a href="#CO023A-023B-P064">paragraph 64</a> above).</p>

<p><title>Remarks concerning capital tax</title>70.  As <a href="#A023B-P001">paragraph 1</a> is drafted, credit is to be allowed for income tax only against income tax and for capital tax only against capital tax. Consequently, credit for or against capital tax will be given only if there is a capital tax in both Contracting States.</p>

<p>71.  In bilateral negotiations, two Contracting States may agree that a tax called a capital tax is of a nature closely related to income tax and may, therefore, wish to allow credit for it against income tax and vice versa. There are cases where, because one State does not impose a capital tax or because both States impose capital taxes only on domestic assets, no double taxation of capital will arise. In such cases it is, of course, understood that the reference to capital taxation may be deleted. Furthermore, States may find it desirable, regardless of the nature of the taxes under the convention, to allow credit for the total amount of tax in the State of source or situs against the total amount of tax in the State of residence. Where, however, a convention includes both real capital taxes and capital taxes which are in their nature income taxes, the States may wish to allow credit against income tax only for the latter capital taxes.

<p><title>Tax sparing</title>72.  Some States grant different kinds of tax incentives to foreign investors for the purpose of attracting foreign investment. When the State of residence of a foreign investor applies the credit method, the benefit of the incentive granted by a State of source may be reduced to the extent that the State of residence, when taxing income that has benefited from the incentive, will allow a deduction only for the tax actually paid in the State of source. Similarly, if the State of residence applies the exemption method but subject the application of that method to a certain level of taxation by the State of source, the granting of a tax reduction by the State of source may have the effect of denying the investor the application of the exemption method in his State of residence.</p>

<p>73.  To avoid any such effect in the State of residence, some States that have adopted tax incentive programmes wish to include provisions, usually referred to as “tax sparing” provisions, in their conventions. The purpose of these provisions is to allow non-residents to obtain a foreign tax credit for the taxes that have been “spared” under the incentive programme of the source State or to ensure that these taxes will be taken into account for the purposes of applying certain conditions that may be attached to exemption systems.</p>

<p>74.  Tax sparing provisions constitute a departure from the provisions of Articles <a href="#A023A">23 A</a> and <a href="#A023B">23 B</a>. Tax sparing provisions may take different forms, as for example:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>the State of residence will allow as a deduction the amount of tax which the State of source could have imposed in accordance with its general legislation or such amount as limited by the Convention (e.g.limitations of rates provided for dividends and interest in Articles <a href="#A010">10</a> and <a href="#A011">11</a>) even if the State of source has waived all or part of that tax under special provisions for the promotion of its economic development;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as a counterpart for the tax reduction by the State of source, the State of residence agrees to allow a deduction against its own tax of an amount (in part fictitious) fixed at a higher rate;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the State of residence exempts the income which has benefited from tax incentives in the State of source.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#CO023A-023B-P074-R">(Replaced on 29 April 2000 see History)</a>75.  A 1998 report by the Committee of Fiscal Affairs, entitled “Tax Sparing: a Reconsideration”,[^73] analyses the tax policy considerations that underlie tax sparing provisions as well as their drafting. The report identifies a number of concerns that put into question the overall usefulness of the granting of tax sparing relief. These concerns relate in particular to:<itemizedlist></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the potential for abuse offered by tax sparing;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the effectiveness of tax sparing as an instrument of foreign aid to promote economic development of the source country; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>general concerns with the way in which tax sparing may encourage States to use tax incentives.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>76.  Experience has shown that tax sparing is very vulnerable to taxpayer abuse, which can be very costly in terms of lost revenue to both the State of residence and the State of source. This kind of abuse is difficult to detect. In addition, even where it is detected, it is difficult for the State of residence to react quickly against such abuse. The process of removing or modifying existing tax sparing provisions to prevent such abuses is often slow and cumbersome.</p>
<p id="CO023A-023B-P076"><a href="#CO023A-023B-P076-R">(Replaced on 29 April 2000 see History)</a></p>
<p>77.  Furthermore, tax sparing is not necessarily an effective tool to promote economic development. A reduction or elimination of the benefit of the tax incentive by the State of residence will, in most cases, only occur to the extent that profits are repatriated. By promoting the repatriation of profits, tax sparing may therefore provide an inherent incentive to foreign investors to engage in short-term investment projects and a disincentive to operate in the source State on a long-term basis. Also, foreign tax credit systems are usually designed in a way that allows a foreign investor, in computing its foreign tax credit, to offset to some extent the reduction of taxes resulting from a particular tax incentive with the higher taxes paid in that or other country so that, ultimately, no additional taxes are levied by the State of residence as a result of the tax incentive.</p>

<p>78.  Finally, the accelerating integration of national economies has made many segments of the national tax bases increasingly geographically mobile. These developments have induced some States to adopt tax regimes that have as their primary purpose the erosion of the tax bases of other countries. These types of tax incentives are specifically tailored to target highly mobile financial and other services that are particularly sensitive to tax differentials. The potentially harmful effects of such regimes may be aggravated by the existence of ill-designed tax sparing provisions in treaties. This is particularly so where a State adopts a tax regime subsequent to the conclusion of treaties and tailors this regime so as to ensure that it is covered by the scope of the existing tax sparing provision.</p>

<p>78.1  The Committee concluded that member States should not necessarily refrain from adopting tax sparing provisions. The Committee expressed the view, however, that tax sparing should be considered only in regard to States the economic level of which is considerably below that of OECD member States. Member States should employ objective economic criteria to define States eligible for tax sparing. Where States agree to insert a tax sparing provision, they are therefore encouraged to follow the guidance set out in section VI of the tax sparing report. The use of these “best practices” will minimise the potential for abuse of such provisions by ensuring that they apply exclusively to genuine investments aimed at developing the domestic infrastructure of the source State. A narrow provision applying to real investment would also discourage harmful tax competition for geographically mobile activities.</p>

<p></paragraphsection><paragraphsection><title>Paragraph 2</title>79.  This paragraph has been added to enable the State of residence to retain the right to take the amount of income or capital exempted in that State into consideration when determining the tax to be imposed on the rest of the income or capital. The right so retained extends to income or capital which “shall be taxable only” in the other State. The principle of progression is thus safeguarded for the State of residence, not only in relation to income or capital which “may be taxed” in the other State, but also for income or capital which “shall be taxable only” in that other State. The Commentary on <a href="#A023A-P003">paragraph 3</a> of Article 23 A in relation to the State of source also applies to <a href="#A023B-P002">paragraph 2</a> of Article 23 B.</p>

<p></paragraphsection><observations><title>Observations on the Commentary</title>80.  The <em>Netherlands</em> in principle is in favour of solving situations of both double taxation and double non-taxation due to conflicts of qualification between Contracting States, since in the Netherland’s view such situations are not intended by the Contracting States and moreover go against the object and purpose of a tax treaty. However, the Netherlands does not agree with the interpretation given in paragraphs <a href="#CO023A-023B-P032.04">32.4</a> and <a href="#CO023A-023B-P032.06">32.6</a> to the phrase “in accordance with the provisions of this Convention” in Articles <a href="#A023A">23 A</a> and <a href="#A023B">23 B</a> of the Convention that in cases of conflicts of qualification that are due to differences in domestic law between the State of source and the State of residence as a rule the qualification given by the State of source would prevail for purposes of the application by the State of residence of Article <a href="#A023A">23 A</a> or <a href="#A023B">23 B</a>. The Netherlands wishes to preserve its right to subject a solution and its modalities for a certain conflict of qualification to the circumstances of the cases at hand and to the relationship with the Contracting State concerned. The Netherlands therefore will adhere to said interpretation in paragraphs <a href="#CO023A-023B-P032.04">32.4</a>and <a href="#CO023A-023B-P032.06">32.6</a> only, and to the extent which, it is explicitly so confirmed in a specific tax treaty, as a result of mutual agreement between competent authorities as meant in <a href="#A025">Article 25</a> of the Convention or as unilateral policy.</p>

Where a resident of State R derives income from a third State through a permanent establishment or a fixed base which he has in State E, such State E may tax such income (except income from immovable property situated in the third State) if it is attributable to such permanent establishment or fixed base (paragraph 2 of Article 21). State R must give relief under Article 23 A or Article 23 B in respect of income attributable to the permanent establishment or fixed base in State E. There is no provision in the Convention for relief to be given by Contracting State E for taxes levied in the third State where the income arises; however, under paragraph 4 of Article 24 any relief provided for in the domestic laws of State E (double taxation conventions excluded) for residents of State E is also to be granted to a permanent establishment in State E of an enterprise of State R (<em>cf</em>. paragraphs 51 to 55 of the Commentary on Article 24). Cases in which more than two States are involved (triangular cases) raise many problems in regard to which not only the convention between the States R and E but also conventions between States R and/or E with State S may come into play. It could be argued that a provision in a convention between State R and State E obliging State E to give credit or exemption for income derived from a third State leads to a more favourable treatment of the permanent establishment than is granted by State E to its own residents, and that the effect of the combined application of domestic laws and of one or more conventions may even result in double or multiple relief. It is, therefore, left to Contracting States to settle the question bilaterally either generally in a convention to be concluded between them or by way of a mutual agreement procedure (Article 25).”</p>

In case (ii) the tax in the State of source would be 8,000 and the State of residence would allow a deduction of 7,000 only, that is the amount of the maximum credit.

In the Conventions concluded between O.E.C.D. Member countries both systems have been adopted. Some States have a preference for one system, some have a preference for the other. Theoretically a single system could be held to be more desirable, but, on account of the preferences referred to, each State has been left free to make its own choice.

In view of this limitation, the Articles have been drafted so that Member countries are left free to choose between two methods: the exemption method with progression [Article 23(A)] and the ordinary credit method [Article 23(B)]. If two Contracting States both adopt the same method, it will be sufficient of the relevant Article is inserted in the Convention.

In the 1977 Model Convention and until 17 July 2008, paragraph 31 read as follows:“31.  Contracting States may use a combination of the two methods. Such combination is indeed necessary for a Contracting State R which generally adopts the exemption method in the case of income which under Articles 10 and 11 may be subjected to a limited tax in the other Contracting State S. For such case, Article 23 A provides in paragraph 2 a credit for the limited tax levied in the other Contracting State S. Moreover, States which in general adopt the exemption method may wish to exclude specific items of income from exemption and to apply to such items the credit method. In such case, paragraph 2 of Article 23 A could be amended to include these items of income.”</p>

Perhaps it may be of interest to add that, in particular circumstances, both methods could be combined with advantage. Thus it will be noted from paragraph 39 that paragraph 2 of Article 23(A) -- the exemption Article -- is drafted in accordance with the credit method, and from paragraphs 47 to 51 that the adoption of the exemption method, in respect of the type of income referred to therein, would obviate difficulties that arise under the credit method.”</p>

After 29 April 2000 and until 28 January 2003, paragraph 32.4 read as follows:“32.4  This point may be illustrated by the following example. A business is carried on through a permanent establishment in State E by a partnership established in that State. A partner, resident in State R, alienates his interest in that partnership. State E treats the partnership as fiscally transparent whereas State R treats it as taxable entity. State E therefore considers that the alienation of the interest in the partnership is, for the purposes of its Convention with State R, an alienation by the partner of the underlying assets of the business carried on by the partnership, which may be taxed by that State in accordance with paragraph 1 or 2 of Article 13. State R, as it treats the partnership as a taxable entity, considers that the alienation of the interest in the partnership is akin to the alienation of a share in a company, which could not be taxed by State E by reason of paragraph 4 of Article 13. In such a case, the conflict of qualification results exclusively from the different treatment of partnerships in the domestic laws of the two States and State E must be considered by State R to have taxed the gain from the alienation “in accordance with the provisions of the Convention” for purposes of the application of Article 23 A or Article 23 B. State R must therefore grant an exemption pursuant to Article 23 A or give a credit pursuant to Article 23 B irrespective of the fact that, under its own domestic law, it treats the alienation gain as income from the disposition of shares in a corporate entity and that, if State E's qualification of the income were consistent with that of State R, State R would not have to give relief under Article 23 A or Article 23 B. No double taxation will therefore arise in such a case.”</p>

After 29 April 2000 and until 28 January 2003, paragraph 32.5 read as follows:“32.5  Article 23 A and Article 23 B, however, do not require that the State of residence eliminate double taxation in all cases where the State of source has imposed its tax by applying to an item of income a provision of the Convention that is different from that which the State of residence considers to be applicable. For instance, in the example above, if, for purposes of applying paragraph 2 of Article 13, State E considers that the partnership carried on business through a fixed place of business but State R considers that paragraph 4 applies because the partnership did not have a fixed place of business in State E, there is actually a dispute as to whether State E has taxed the income in accordance with the provisions of the Convention. The same may be said if State E, when applying paragraph 2 of Article 13, interprets the phrase “forming part of the business property” so as to include certain assets which would not fall within the meaning of that phrase according to the interpretation given to it by State R. Such conflicts resulting from different interpretation of facts or different interpretation of the provisions of the Convention must be distinguished from the conflicts of qualification described in the above paragraph where the divergence is based not on different interpretations of the provisions of the Convention but on different provisions of domestic law. In the former case, State R can argue that State E has not imposed its tax in accordance with the provisions of the Convention if it has applied its tax based on what State R considers to be a wrong interpretation of the facts or a wrong interpretation of the Convention. States should use the provisions of Article 25 (Mutual Agreement Procedure), and in particular paragraph 3 thereof, in order to resolve this type of conflict in cases that would otherwise result in unrelieved double taxation.”</p>
<p>Paragraph 32.5 was added on 29 April 2000 by the report entitled “The 2000 Update to the Model Tax Convention”, adopted by the OECD Committee on Fiscal Affairs on 29 April 2000 on the basis of Annex I of another report entitled “The Application of the OECD Model Tax Convention to Partnerships” (adopted by the OECD Committee on Fiscal Affairs on 20 January 1999).</p>

After 29 April 2000 and until 17 July 2008, paragraph 32.6 read as follows:“32.6  The phrase “in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, may be taxed” must also be interpreted in relation to possible cases of double non-taxation that can arise under Article 23 A. Where the State of source considers that the provisions of the Convention preclude it from taxing an item of income or capital which it would otherwise have taxed, the State of residence should, for purposes of applying paragraph 1 of Article 23 A, consider that the item of income may not be taxed by the State of source in accordance with the provisions of the Convention, even though the State of residence would have applied the Convention differently so as to tax that income if it had been in the position of the State of source. Thus the State of residence is not required by paragraph 1 to exempt the item of income, a result which is consistent with the basic function of Article 23 which is to eliminate double taxation.”</p>

After 29 April 2000 and until 28 January 2003, paragraph 32.7 read as follows:“32.7  This situation may be illustrated by reference to a variation of the example described above. A business is carried on through a fixed place of business in State E by a partnership established in that State and a partner, resident in State R, alienates his interest in that partnership. Changing the facts of the example, however, it is now assumed that State E treats the partnership as a taxable entity whereas State R treats it as fiscally transparent; it is further assumed that State R is a State that applies the exemption method. State E, as it treats the partnership as a corporate entity, considers that the alienation of the interest in the partnership is akin to the alienation of a share in a company, which it cannot tax by reason of paragraph 4 of Article 13. State R, on the other hand, considers that the alienation of the interest in the partnership should have been taxable by State E as an alienation by the partner of the underlying assets of the business carried on by the partnership to which paragraphs 1 or 2 of Article 13 would have been applicable. In determining whether it has the obligation to exempt the income under paragraph 1 of Article 23 A, State R should nonetheless consider that, given the way that the provisions of the Convention apply in conjunction with the domestic law of State E, that State may not tax the income in accordance with the provisions of the Convention. State R is thus under no obligation to exempt the income.”</p>

<p id="">32.  In the Article it is laid down that the State of residence shall exempt from tax income and capital, which in accordance with the Convention “may be taxed” in the other State. The State of residence must accordingly give exemption whether or not the income or capital in question is actually taxed in the State of source. This is in accordance with most Conventions based on the exemption system between O.E.C.D. Member countries. It is regarded as the most practical method since it relieves the State of residence from undertaking onerous and time-consuming investigations of the actual taxation position in the State of source.”</p>

In the 1963 Draft Convention (adopted by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963) and until the adoption of the 1977 Model Convention, paragraph 35 read as follows:“35.  The provision concerning progression, proposed in the Article, relates only to the State of residence. A question arises, however, when a State of source which applies a progressive tax scale gives up the right to tax and the non-resident taxpayer derives other income from that State. Different principles may be applied by a State of source in determining its progression. Its internal tax law may provide for the calculation of the progression on the global income of the taxpayer or only on the total income arising to the taxpayer in the State of source.”</p>

In the 1977 Model Convention and until 29 April 2000, paragraph 36 read as follows:“36.  As already mentioned in paragraph 31 above, the exemption method does not apply to such items of income which according to the Convention may be taxed in the State of residence but may also be subjected to a limited tax in the other Contracting State.

In the 1963 Draft Convention (adopted by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963) and until the adoption of the 1977 Model Convention, paragraph 37 and the preceding heading read as follows:“C.       Alternative Formulation of the Article</p>
<p id="">37.  An effect of the exemption system as it is drafted in the Article is that the taxable income or capital in the State of residence is reduced by the amount which the State of residence exempts. If in a particular State the amount of income as determined for income tax purposes is used as a measure for other purposes, e.g. social benefits, the application of the exemption system in the form proposed may have the effect that such benefits may be given to persons who ought not to receive them. To avoid such consequences, the Article may be altered so that the income in question is included in the taxable income in the State of residence. The State of residence must then in such cases give up that part of the total tax appropriate to the income concerned. This procedure would give the same result as the Article in the form proposed. States can be left free to make such modifications in the drafting of the Article. If a State wants to draft the Article as indicated above, paragraph 1 may be drafted as follows:“Where a resident of a Contracting State derives income or owns capital which, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, may be taxed in the other Contracting State, the first-mentioned State shall, subject to the provisions of paragraph 2, allow as a deduction from the income tax or capital tax that part of the income tax or capital tax, respectively, which is appropriate, as the case may be, to the income derived from or the capital owned in that other Contracting State.”</p>

In the 1977 Model Convention and until 22 July 2010, paragraph 38 read as follows:“38.  Article 23 A contains the principle that the State of residence has to give exemption, but does not give detailed rules on how the exemption has to be implemented. This is consistent with the general pattern of the Convention. Articles 6 to 22 too lay down rules attributing the right to tax in respect of the various types of income or capital without dealing, as a rule, with the determination of taxable income or capital, deductions, rate of tax, etc. (<em>cf</em>., however, paragraph 3 of Article 7 and Article 24). Experience has shown that many problems may arise. This is especially true with respect to Article 23 A. Some of them are dealt with in the following paragraphs. In the absence of a specific provision in the Convention, the domestic laws of each Contracting State are applicable. Some conventions contain an express reference to the domestic laws but of course this would not help where the exemption method is not used in the domestic laws. In such cases, Contracting States which face this problem should establish rules for the application of Article 23 A, if necessary, after having consulted with the competent authority of the other Contracting State (paragraph 3 of Article 25).”</p>

If a resident of one State derives income of different kinds from the State of source and that State, according to its tax law, imposes tax only on one of these incomes, the maximum deduction which the State of residence is to allow will be that part of its tax which is appropriate only to that item of income which is taxed in the State of source. If a resident of one State, deriving income from another State, has a loss in his State of residence — less than the income from abroad — the total tax charged in the State of residence will be appropriate to the income from the State of source, and the maximum deduction which the State of residence is to allow will consequently be the tax charged in that State.”</p>

A modification of the credit method was requested by Italy. The Italian taxation system is based predominantly on the principle of the territoriality of the tax, that is to say, in principle, any income arising abroad is not taxable in Italy for the purposes of the impersonal or schedular taxes (i.e. tax on income from movable property, tax on income from built-up property, tax on income from land, etc.) but, when taxable, is charged to the progressive complementary tax or to the company tax. In view of that fact, Italy wishes to limit the credit to that part only of the tax paid abroad which exceeds the Italian impersonal or schedular tax not charged in Italy.

<p id=""><strong><a href="#CO023A-023B-P046">Paragraph 46</a></strong>: Amended on 23 July 1992, by replacing the references therein to paragraphs 36 to 65, 39 and 43 of the Commentary on Article 10 with references to paragraphs 40 to 67, 43 and 47 respectively, by the report entitled “The Revision of the Model Convention”, adopted by the OECD Council on 23 July 1992. In the 1977 Model Convention and until 23 July 1992, paragraph 46 read as follows:“46.  Certain States have introduced special systems for taxing corporate income (<em>cf</em>. paragraphs 36 to 65 of the Commentary on Article 10). In States applying a split rate corporation tax (paragraph 39 of the said Commentary), the problem may arise whether the income to be exempted has to be deducted from undistributed income (to which the normal rate of tax applies) or from distributed income (to which the reduced rate applies) or whether the income to be exempted has to be attributed partly to distributed and partly to undistributed income. Where, under the laws of a State applying the split rate corporation tax, a supplementary tax is levied in the hands of a parent company on dividends which it received from a domestic subsidiary company but which it does not redistribute (on the grounds that such supplementary tax is a compensation for the benefit of a lower tax rate granted to the subsidiary on the distributions), the problem arises, whether such supplementary tax may be charged where the subsidiary pays its dividends out of income exempt from tax by virtue of the Convention. Finally a similar problem may arise in connection with taxes (précompte, Advance Corporation Tax) which are levied on distributed profits of a corporation in order to cover the tax credit attributable to the shareholders (<em>cf</em>. paragraph 43 of the Commentary on Article 10). The question is whether such special taxes connected with the distribution of profits, could be levied insofar as distributions are made out of profits exempt from tax. It is left to Contracting States to settle these questions by bilateral negotiations.”</p>

<p id=""><strong><a href="#CO023A-023B-P047">Paragraph 47</a></strong>: Amended on 23 July 1992, by replacing the references therein to paragraphs 70 to 76 with a reference to paragraphs 72 to 78, by the report entitled “The Revision of the Model Convention”, adopted by the OECD Council on 23 July 1992. In the 1977 Model Convention and until 23 July 1992, paragraph 47 read as follows:“47.  In Articles 10 and 11 the right to tax dividends and interest is divided between the State of residence and the State of source. In these cases, the State of residence is left free not to tax if it wants to do so (<em>cf</em>.e.g.paragraphs 70 to 76 below) and to apply the exemption method also to the above-mentioned items of income. However, where the State of residence prefers to make use of its right to tax such items of income, it cannot apply the exemption method to eliminate the double taxation since it would thus give up fully its right to tax the income concerned. For the State of residence, the application of the credit method would normally seem to give a satisfactory solution. Moreover, as already indicated in paragraph 31 above, States which in general apply the exemption method may wish to apply to specific items of income the credit method rather than exemption. Consequently, the paragraph is drafted in accordance with the ordinary credit method. The Commentary on Article 23 B hereafter appliesmutatis mutandisto paragraph 2 of Article 23 A.”</p>
<p id="">Paragraph 47 of the 1977 Model Convention corresponded to paragraph 39 of the 1963 Draft Convention. Paragraph 47 of the 1963 Draft Convention was amended and renumbered as paragraph 70 (see history of paragraph 72) and the preceding heading was moved with it when the 1977 Model Convention was adopted by the OECD Council on 11 April 1977. At the same time, paragraph 39 of the 1963 Draft Convention was amended and renumbered as paragraph 47 of the 1977 Model Convention and the preceding heading was moved with it. In the 1963 Draft Convention (adopted by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963) and until the adoption of the 1977 Model Convention, paragraph 39 read as follows :“39.  In Articles 10 and 11 the right to tax dividends and interest is divided between the State of residence and the State of source. Such is also the case with respect to royalties, as regards Greece, Luxembourg, Portugal and Spain. As a consequence double taxation in these cases cannot be expected to be avoided by the application of the exemption method since this method secures that the State of residence gives up its right to tax the income concerned, but the State of residence is left free to apply the exemption method if it wants to do so. For the State of residence the application of the credit method would normally seem to give a satisfactory solution. Consequently, the paragraph is drafted in accordance with the ordinary credit method. If, however, a given Contracting State has a special tax system (e.g. Switzerland) where the tax credit method is not yet applied and where it therefore would be difficult to apply such method as provided for by paragraph 2 of the Article, such Contracting State may, in bilateral negotiations, use other measures in order to alleviate the double taxation mentioned in such paragraph 2.</p>

In the 1977 Model Convention and until 15 July 2014, paragraph 48 read as follows:“48.  In the cases referred to in the previous paragraph, certain maximum percentages are laid down for tax reserved to the State of source. In such cases, the rate of tax in the State of residence will very often be higher than the rate in the State of source. The limitation of the deduction which is laid down in the second sentence of paragraph 2 and which is in accordance with the ordinary credit method is therefore of consequence only in a limited number of cases. If, in such cases, the Contracting States prefer to waive the limitation and to apply the full credit method, they can do so by deleting the second sentence of paragraph 2 (see also paragraph 63 below).”</p>

In the cases referred to in the previous paragraph certain maximum percentages are laid down for tax reserved to the State of source. In such cases the rate of tax in the State of residence will very often be higher than the rate in the State of course. Consequently, a limitation of the deduction in accordance with the ordinary credit method would have only a limited significance.

The 1963 Draft Convention reserved expressly the application of the progressive scale of tax rates by the State of residence (last sentence of paragraph 1 of Article 23 A) and most conventions concluded between OECD member countries, which adopt the exemption method follow this principle. According to paragraph 3 of Article 23 A, as amended, the State of residence retains the right to take the amount of exempted income or capital into consideration when determining the tax to be imposed on the rest of the income or capital. The rule applies even where the exempted income (or items of capital) and the taxable income (or items of capital) accrue to those persons (e.g.husband and wife) whose incomes (or items of capital) are taxed jointly according to the domestic laws. This principle of progression applies to income or capital exempted by virtue of paragraph 1 of Article 23 A as well as to income or capital which under any other provision of the Convention “shall be taxable only” in the other Contracting State (<em>cf</em>. paragraph 6 above).

<p id=""><strong><a href="#CO023A-023B-P063">Paragraph 63</a></strong>: Amended on 15 July 2014 by the Report entitled “The 2014 Update to the Model Tax Convention”, adopted by the Council of the OECD on 15 July 2014. In the 1977 Model Convention and until 15 July 2014, paragraph 63 read as follows:“63.  The maximum deduction is normally computed as the tax on net income,i.e.on the income from State E (or S) less allowable deductions (specified or proportional) connected with such income (see paragraph 40 above). For such reason, the maximum deduction in many cases may be lower than the tax effectively paid in State E (or S). This may especially be true in the case where, for instance, a resident of State R deriving interest from State S has borrowed funds from a third person to finance the interest-producing loan. As the interest due on such borrowed money may be offset against the interest derived from State S, the amount of net income subject to tax in State R may be very small, or there may even be no net income at all. This problem could be solved by using the full credit method in State R as mentioned in paragraph 48 above. Another solution would be to exempt such income from tax in State S, as it is proposed in the Commentary in respect of interest on credit sales and on loans granted by banks (see paragraph 15 of the Commentary on Article 11).”</p>

There will be cases where, because one State does not impose a capital tax or because both States impose capital taxes only on domestic assets, no double taxation of capital will arise. In such cases it is, of course understood that the reference to capital taxation may be deleted. Furthermore, negotiating States may find it desirable, regardless of the nature of the taxes included under the Convention, to allow credit for the total amount of tax in the State of source against the total amount of tax in the State of residence. Where, however, a Convention includes both real capital taxes and capital taxes which are in their nature income taxes, the Contracting States may wish to allow credit against income tax only for the latter mentioned capital taxes.

One method of deviation might be that, where such “tax-spared” income is in question, the exemption method could, as pointed out in paragraph 48, be applied. Already, to cover special cases, a deviation from the exemption method, which embodies the credit method, has been proposed in paragraph 2 of Article 23(A), so that a deviation in this case from the credit method embodying the exemption method might be acceptable. Another deviation might be the adoption of what is called “matching credit”. This method secures that the State of residence will allow as a deduction from its own tax an amount corresponding to the tax which would have been paid in the State of source if no concession had been granted by that State. In order that the system should give satisfactory results, it is necessary that the State of source should be able to notify to the State of residence the amount of tax that would have been paid if no relief had been granted.</p>
