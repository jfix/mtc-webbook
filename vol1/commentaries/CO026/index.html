<p>1.  There are good grounds for including in a convention for the avoidance of double taxation provisions concerning co-operation between the tax administrations of the two Contracting States. In the first place it appears to be desirable to give administrative assistance for the purpose of ascertaining facts in relation to which the rules of the convention are to be applied. Moreover, in view of the increasing internationalisation of economic relations, the Contracting States have a growing interest in the reciprocal supply of information on the basis of which domestic taxation laws have to be administered, even if there is no question of the application of any particular article of the Convention.</p>
<p id="CO026-P001"><a href="#CO026-P001-R">(Replaced on 11 April 1977 see History)</a></p>
<p>2.  Therefore the present Article embodies the rules under which information may be exchanged to the widest possible extent, with a view to laying the proper basis for the implementation of the domestic tax laws of the Contracting States and for the application of specific provisions of the Convention. The text of the Article makes it clear that the exchange of information is not restricted by <a href="#A001">Articles 1</a> and <a href="#A002">2</a>, so that the information may include particulars about non-residents and may relate to the administration or enforcement of taxes not referred to in <a href="#A002">Article 2</a>.</p>
<p id="CO026-P002"><a href="#CO026-P002-R">(Amended on 15 July 2005 see History)</a></p>
<p>3.  The matter of administrative assistance for the purpose of tax collection is dealt with in <a href="#A027">Article 27</a>, but exchanges of information for the purpose of tax collection are governed by <a href="#A026">Article 26</a> (see <a href="#A027-P005">paragraph 5</a> of the Commentary on Article 27). Similarly, mutual agreement procedures are dealt with in <a href="#A025">Article 25</a>, but exchanges of information for the purposes of a mutual agreement procedure are governed by <a href="#A026">Article 26</a> (see <a href="#A025-P004">paragraph 4</a> of the Commentary on Article 25).</p>
<p id="CO026-P003"><a href="#CO026-P003-R">(Amended on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>4.  In 2002, the Committee on Fiscal Affairs undertook a comprehensive review of <a href="#A026">Article 26</a>to ensure that it reflects current country practices. That review also took into account recent developments such as the <em>Model Agreement on Exchange of Information on Tax Matters</em> developed by the OECD Global Forum Working Group on Effective Exchange of Information and the ideal standard of access to bank information as described in the report <em>Improving Access to Bank Information for Tax Purposes</em>.[^80] As a result, several changes to both the text of the Article and the Commentary were made in 2005.</p>
<p id="CO026-P004"><a href="#CO026-P004-R">(Amended on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>4.1  Many of the changes that were then made to the Article were not intended to alter its substance, but instead were made to remove doubts as to its proper interpretation. For instance, the change from “necessary” to “foreseeably relevant” and the insertion of the words “to the administration or enforcement” in <a href="#A026-P001">paragraph 1</a> were made to achieve consistency with the <em>Model Agreement on Exchange of Information on Tax Matters</em> and were not intended to alter the effect of the provision. <a href="#A026-P004">Paragraph 4</a> was added to incorporate into the text of the Article the general understanding previously expressed in the Commentary (see <a href="#CO026-P019.06">paragraph 19.6</a>). <a href="#A026-P005">Paragraph 5</a>was added to reflect practices among the vast majority of OECD member countries (see <a href="#CO026-P019.10">paragraph 19.10</a>). The insertion of the words “or the oversight of the above” into <a href="#A026-P002">paragraph 2</a>, on the other hand, constituted a reversal of the previous rule.</p>
<p id="CO026-P004.01"><a href="#CO026-P004.01-R">(Amended on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>4.2  The Commentary was also expanded considerably. This expansion in part reflected the addition of <a href="#A026-P004">XREFSTYLE=ParasLabel</a> and <a href="#A026-P005">5</a> to the Article. Other changes were made to the Commentary to take into account developments and country practices and more generally to remove doubts as to the proper interpretation of the Article.</p>
<p id="CO026-P004.02"><a href="#CO026-P004.02-R">(Amended on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>4.3  The Article and the Commentary were further modified in 2012 to take into account recent developments and to further elaborate on the interpretation of certain provisions of this Article. <a href="#A026-P002">Paragraph 2</a> of the Article was amended to allow the competent authorities to use information received for other purposes provided such use is allowed under the laws of both States and the competent authority of the supplying State authorises such use. This was previously included as an optional provision in <a href="#CO026-P012.03">paragraph 12.3</a> of the Commentary.</p>
<p id="CFAJDBGH"><a href="#CO026-P004.03-R">(Added on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>4.4  The Commentary was expanded to develop the interpretation of the standard of “foreseeable relevance” and the term “fishing expeditions” through the addition of: general clarifications (see <a href="#CO026-P005">paragraph 5</a>), language in respect of the identification of the taxpayer under examination or investigation (see <a href="#CO026-P005.01">paragraph 5.1</a>), language in respect of requests in relation to a group of taxpayers (see <a href="#CO026-P005.02">paragraph 5.2</a>) and new examples (see subparagraphs <em>e</em>) to <em>h</em>) of <a href="#CO026-P008">paragraph 8</a> and <a href="#CO026-P008.01">paragraph 8.1</a>). The Commentary further provides for an optional default standard of time limits within which the information is required to be provided unless a different agreement has been made by the competent authorities (see paragraphs <a href="#CO026-P010.04">10.4</a> to <a href="#CO026-P010.06">10.6</a>) and that in accordance with the principle of reciprocity, if a Contracting State applies under <a href="#A026-P005">paragraph 5</a> measures not normally foreseen in its domestic law or practice, such as to access and exchange bank information, that State is equally entitled to request similar information from the other Contracting State (see <a href="#CO026-P015">paragraph 15</a>). Other clarifications were added in paragraphs <a href="#CO026-P003">3</a>, <a href="#CFAEHCAA">5.3</a>, <a href="#CO026-P006">6</a>, <a href="#CO026-P011">11</a>, <a href="#CO026-P012">12</a>, <a href="#CO026-P012.03">12.3</a>, <a href="#CO026-P012.04">12.4</a>, <a href="#CO026-P016">16</a>, <a href="#CO026-P016.01">16.1</a> and <a href="#CO026-P019.07">19.7</a>.</p>

<h2 id="ii-commentary-on-the-provisions-of-the-article">II. Commentary on the provisions of the Article<a class="headerlink" href="#ii-commentary-on-the-provisions-of-the-article" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p><paragraphsection><title>Paragraph 1</title>5.  The main rule concerning the exchange of information is contained in the first sentence of the paragraph. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is foreseeably relevant to secure the correct application of the provisions of the Convention or of the domestic laws of the Contracting States concerning taxes of every kind and description imposed in these States even if, in the latter case, a particular Article of the Convention need not be applied. The standard of “foreseeable relevance” is intended to provide for exchange of information in tax matters to the widest possible extent and, at the same time, to clarify that Contracting States are not at liberty to engage in “fishing expeditions” or to request information that is unlikely to be relevant to the tax affairs of a given taxpayer. In the context of information exchange upon request, the standard requires that at the time a request is made there is a reasonable possibility that the requested information will be relevant; whether the information, once provided, actually proves to be relevant is immaterial. A request may therefore not be declined in cases where a definite assessment of the pertinence of the information to an ongoing investigation can only be made following the receipt of the information. The competent authorities should consult in situations in which the content of the request, the circumstances that led to the request, or the foreseeable relevance of requested information are not clear to the requested State. However, once the requesting State has provided an explanation as to the foreseeable relevance of the requested information, the requested State may not decline a request or withhold requested information because it believes that the information lacks relevance to the underlying investigation or examination. Where the requested State becomes aware of facts that call into question whether part of the information requested is foreseeably relevant, the competent authorities should consult and the requested State may ask the requesting State to clarify foreseeable relevance in the light of those facts. At the same time, <a href="#A026-P001">paragraph 1</a> does not obligate the requested State to provide information in response to requests that are “fishing expeditions”,i.e.speculative requests that have no apparent nexus to an open inquiry or investigation.</p>
<p id="CO026-P005"><a href="#CO026-P005-R">(Amended on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>5.1  As is the case under the <em>Model Agreement on Exchange of Information on Tax Matters</em> [^81] a request for information does not constitute a fishing expedition solely because it does not provide the name or address (or both) of the taxpayer under examination or investigation. The same holds true where names are spelt differently or information on names and addresses is presented using a different format. However, in cases in which the requesting State does not provide the name or address (or both) of the taxpayer under examination or investigation, the requesting State must include other information sufficient to identify the taxpayer. Similarly, <a href="#A026-P001">paragraph 1</a> does not necessarily require the request to include the name and/or address of the person believed to be in possession of the information. In fact, the question of how specific a request has to be with respect to such person is typically an issue falling within the scope of subparagraphs <em>a</em>) and <em>b</em>) of <a href="#A026-P003">paragraph 3</a> of Article 26.</p>
<p id="CO026-P005.01"><a href="#CO026-P005.01-R">(Replaced on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>5.2  The standard of “foreseeable relevance” can be met both in cases dealing with one taxpayer (whether identified by name or otherwise) or several taxpayers (whether identified by name or otherwise). Where a Contracting State undertakes an investigation into a particular group of taxpayers in accordance with its laws, any request related to the investigation will typically serve “the administration or enforcement” of its domestic tax laws and thus comply with the requirements of <a href="#A026-P001">paragraph 1</a>, provided it meets the standard of “foreseeable relevance”. However, where the request relates to a group of taxpayers not individually identified, it will often be more difficult to establish that the request is not a fishing expedition, as the requesting State cannot point to an ongoing investigation into the affairs of a particular taxpayer which in most cases would by itself dispel the notion of the request being random or speculative. In such cases it is therefore necessary that the requesting State provide a detailed description of the group and the specific facts and circumstances that have led to the request, an explanation of the applicable law and why there is reason to believe that the taxpayers in the group for whom information is requested have been non-compliant with that law supported by a clear factual basis. It further requires a showing that the requested information would assist in determining compliance by the taxpayers in the group. As illustrated in the example in subparagraph <em>h</em>) of <a href="#CO026-P008">paragraph 8</a>, in the case of a group request a third party will usually, although not necessarily, have actively contributed to the non-compliance of the taxpayers in the group, in which case such circumstance should also be described in the request. Furthermore, and as illustrated in the example in subparagraph <em>a</em>) of <a href="#CO026-P008.01">paragraph 8.1</a>, a group request that merely describes the provision of financial services to non-residents and mentions the possibility of non-compliance by the non-resident customers does not meet the standard of foreseeable relevance.</p>
<p id="CO026-P005.02"><a href="#CO026-P005.02-R">(Replaced on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>5.3  Contracting States may agree to an alternative formulation of the standard of foreseeable relevance that is consistent with the scope of the Article and is therefore understood to require an effective exchange of information (e.g.by replacing, “is foreseeably relevant” with “is necessary”, “is relevant” or “may be relevant”). The scope of exchange of information covers all tax matters without prejudice to the general rules and legal provisions governing the rights of defendants and witnesses in judicial proceedings. Exchange of information for criminal tax matters can also be based on bilateral or multilateral treaties on mutual legal assistance (to the extent they also apply to tax crimes). In order to keep the exchange of information within the framework of the Convention, a limitation to the exchange of information is set so that information should be given only insofar as the taxation under the domestic taxation laws concerned is not contrary to the Convention.</p>
<p id="CFAEHCAA"><a href="#CO026-P005.03-R">(Renumbered on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>5.4  The information covered by <a href="#A026-P001">paragraph 1</a> is not limited to taxpayer-specific information. The competent authorities may also exchange other sensitive information related to tax administration and compliance improvement, for example risk analysis techniques or tax avoidance or evasion schemes.</p>
<p id="CFAJJGFH"><a href="#CO026-P005.04-R">(Renumbered on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>5.5  The possibilities of assistance provided by the Article do not limit, nor are they limited by, those contained in existing international agreements or other arrangements between the Contracting States which relate to co-operation in tax matters. Since the exchange of information concerning the application of custom duties has a legal basis in other international instruments, the provisions of these more specialised instruments will generally prevail and the exchange of information concerning custom duties will not, in practice, be governed by the Article.</p>
<p id="CFACJEBA"><a href="#CO026-P005.05-R">(Renumbered on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>6.  The following examples seek to clarify the principles dealt with in paragraphs <a href="#CO026-P005">5</a>, <a href="#CO026-P005.01">5.1</a> and <a href="#CO026-P005.02">5.2</a> above. In the examples mentioned in paragraphs <a href="#CO026-P007">7</a> and <a href="#CO026-P008">8</a> information can be exchanged under <a href="#A026-P001">paragraph 1</a> of Article 26. In the examples mentioned in <a href="#CO026-P008.01">paragraph 8.1</a>, and assuming no further information is provided, the Contracting States are not obligated to provide information in response to a request for information. The examples are for illustrative purposes only. They should be read in the light of the overarching purpose of <a href="#A026">Article 26</a> not to restrict the scope of exchange of information but to allow information exchange “to the widest possible extent”.</p>

<p>7.  Application of the Convention</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When applying <a href="#A012">Article 12</a>, State A where the beneficiary is resident asks State B where the payer is resident, for information concerning the amount of royalty transmitted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conversely, in order to grant the exemption provided for in <a href="#A012">Article 12</a>, State B asks State A whether the recipient of the amounts paid is in fact a resident of the last-mentioned State and the beneficial owner of the royalties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similarly, information may be needed with a view to the proper allocation of taxable profits between associated companies in different States or the adjustment of the profits shown in the accounts of a permanent establishment in one State and in the accounts of the head office in the other State (<a href="#A007">Articles 7</a>, <a href="#A009">9</a>, <a href="#A023A">23 A</a> and <a href="#A023B">23 B</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information may be needed for the purposes of applying <a href="#A025">Article 25</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When applying <a href="#A015">Articles 15</a> and <a href="#A023A">23 A</a>, State A, where the employee is resident, informs State B, where the employment is exercised for more than 183 days, of the amount exempted from taxation in State A.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#CO026-P007-R">(Amended on 15 July 2014 see History)</a>8.  Implementation of the domestic laws</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A company in State A supplies goods to an independent company in State B. State A wishes to know from State B what price the company in State B paid for the goods with a view to a correct application of the provisions of its domestic laws.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A company in State A sells goods through a company in State C (possibly a low-tax country) to a company in State B. The companies may or may not be associated. There is no convention between State A and State C, nor between State B and State C. Under the convention between A and B, State A, with a view to ensuring the correct application of the provisions of its domestic laws to the profits made by the company situated in its territory, asks State B what price the company in State B paid for the goods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State A, for the purpose of taxing a company situated in its territory, asks State B, under the convention between A and B, for information about the prices charged by a company in State B, or a group of companies in State B with which the company in State A has no business contacts in order to enable it to check the prices charged by the company in State A by direct comparison (e.g.prices charged by a company or a group of companies in a dominant position). It should be borne in mind that the exchange of information in this case might be a difficult and delicate matter owing in particular to the provisions of subparagraph <em>c)</em> of <a href="#A026-P003">paragraph 3</a> relating to business and other secrets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State A, for the purpose of verifying VAT input tax credits claimed by a company situated in its territory for services performed by a company resident in State B, requests confirmation that the cost of services was properly entered into the books and records of the company in State B.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tax authorities of State A conduct a tax investigation into the affairs of Mr. X. Based on this investigation the tax authorities have indications that Mr. X holds one or several undeclared bank accounts with Bank B in State B. However, State A has experienced that, in order to avoid detection, it is not unlikely that the bank accounts may be held in the name of relatives of the beneficial owner. State A therefore requests information on all accounts with Bank B of which Mr. X is the beneficial owner and all accounts held in the names of his spouse E and his children K and L.</p>

<p>State A has obtained information on all transactions involving foreign credit cards carried out in its territory in a certain year. State A has processed the data and launched an investigation that identified all credit card numbers where the frequency and pattern of transactions and the type of use over the course of that year suggest that the cardholders were tax residents of State A. State A cannot obtain the names by using regular sources of information available under its internal taxation procedure, as the pertinent information is not in the possession or control of persons within its jurisdiction. The credit card numbers identify an issuer of such cards to be Bank B in State B. Based on an open inquiry or investigation, State A sends a request for information to State B, asking for the name, address and date of birth of the holders of the particular cards identified during its investigation and any other person that has signatory authority over those cards. State A supplies the relevant individual credit card numbers and further provides the above information to demonstrate the foreseeable relevance of the requested information to its investigation and more generally to the administration and enforcement of its tax law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Company A, resident of State A, is owned by foreign unlisted Company B, resident of State B. The tax authorities of State A suspect that managers X, Y and Z of Company A directly or indirectly own Company B. If that were the case, the dividends received by Company B from Company A would be taxable in their hands as resident shareholders under State A’s controlled foreign company rules. The suspicion is based on information provided to State A’s tax authorities by a former employee of Company A. When confronted with the allegations, the three managers of Company A deny having any ownership interest in Company B. The State A tax authorities have exhausted all domestic means of obtaining ownership information on Company B. State A now requests from State B information on whether X, Y and Z are shareholders of Company B. Furthermore, considering that ownership in such cases is often held through, for example, shell companies and nominee shareholders it requests information from State B on whether X, Y and Z indirectly hold an ownership interest in Company B. If State B is unable to determine whether X, Y or Z holds such an indirect interest, information is requested on the shareholder(s) so that it can continue its investigations.[^82] </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Financial service provider B is established in State B. The tax authorities of State A have discovered that B is marketing a financial product to State A residents using misleading information suggesting that the product eliminates the State A income tax liability on the income accumulated within the product. The product requires that an account be opened with B through which the investment is made. State A’s tax authorities have issued a taxpayer alert, warning all taxpayers about the product and clarifying that it does not achieve the suggested tax effect and that income generated by the product must be reported. Nevertheless, B continues to market the product on its website, and State A has evidence that it also markets the product through a network of advisors. State A has already discovered several resident taxpayers that have invested in the product, all of whom had failed to report the income generated by their investments. State A has exhausted its domestic means of obtaining information on the identity of its residents that have invested in the product. State A requests information from the competent authority of State B on all State A residents that (<em>i</em>) have an account with B and (<em>ii</em>) have invested in the financial product. In the request, State A provides the above information, including details of the financial product and the status of its investigation.</p>

<p><a href="#CO026-P008-R">(Amended on 15 July 2014 see History)</a>8.1  Situations where Contracting States are not obligated to provide information in response to a request for information, assuming no further information is provided</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Bank B is a bank established in State B. State A taxes its residents on the basis of their worldwide income. The competent authority of State A requests that the competent authority of State B provide the names, date and place of birth, and account balances (including information on any financial assets held in such accounts) of residents of State A that have an account with, hold signatory authority over, or a beneficial interest in an account with Bank B in State B. The request states that Bank B is known to have a large group of foreign account holders but does not contain any additional information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Company B is a company established in State B. State A requests the names of all shareholders in Company B resident of State A and information on all dividend payments made to such shareholders. The requesting State A points out that Company B has significant business activity in State A and is therefore likely to have shareholders resident of State A. The request further states that it is well known that taxpayers often fail to disclose foreign source income or assets.</p>

<p><a href="#CO026-P008.01-R">(Added on 15 July 2014 see History)</a>9.  The rule laid down in <a href="#A026-P001">paragraph 1</a> allows information to be exchanged in three different ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>on request, with a special case in mind, it being understood that the regular sources of information available under the internal taxation procedure should be relied upon in the first place before a request for information is made to the other State;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>automatically, for example when information about one or various categories of income having their source in one Contracting State and received in the other Contracting State is transmitted systematically to the other State; see the Recommendations of the OECD Council C(97)29/FINAL, dated 13 March 1997 (<em>Recommendation on the use of Tax Identification Numbers in an international context</em>) and C(2001)28/FINAL, dated 22 March 2001 (<em>Recommendation on the use of the OECD Model Memorandum of Understanding on Automatic Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes</em>);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>spontaneously, for example in the case of a State having acquired through certain investigations, information which it supposes to be of interest to the other State.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#CO026-P009-R">(Amended on 15 July 2014 see History)</a>9.1  These three forms of exchange (on request, automatic and spontaneous) may also be combined. It should also be stressed that the Article does not restrict the possibilities of exchanging information to these methods and that the Contracting States may use other techniques to obtain information which may be relevant to both Contracting States such as simultaneous examinations, tax examinations abroad and industry-wide exchange of information. These techniques are fully described in the publication <em>Tax Information Exchange between OECD Member Countries: A Survey of Current Practices</em> [^83] and can be summarised as follows:<itemizedlist></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a simultaneous examination is an arrangement between two or more parties to examine simultaneously each in its own territory, the tax affairs of (a) taxpayer(s) in which they have a common or related interest, with a view of exchanging any relevant information which they so obtain (see the OECD Council Recommendation C(92)81, dated 23 July 1992, on an OECD Model agreement for the undertaking of simultaneous examinations);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a tax examination abroad allows for the possibility to obtain information through the presence of representatives of the competent authority of the requesting Contracting State. To the extent allowed by its domestic law, a Contracting State may permit authorised representatives of the other Contracting State to enter the first Contracting State to interview individuals or examine a person’s books and records, — or to be present at such interviews or examinations carried out by the tax authorities of the first Contracting State — in accordance with procedures mutually agreed upon by the competent authorities. Such a request might arise, for example, where the taxpayer in a Contracting State is permitted to keep records in the other Contracting State. This type of assistance is granted on a reciprocal basis. Countries’ laws and practices differ as to the scope of rights granted to foreign tax officials. For instance, there are States where a foreign tax official will be prevented from any active participation in an investigation or examination on the territory of a country; there are also States where such participation is only possible with the taxpayer’s consent. The Joint Council of Europe/OECD Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters specifically addresses tax examinations abroad in its <a href="#A009">Article 9</a>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an industry-wide exchange of information is the exchange of tax information especially concerning a whole economic sector (e.g.the oil or pharmaceutical industry, the banking sector, etc.) and not taxpayers in particular.</p>

</ul>

<p>10.  The manner in which the exchange of information agreed to in the Convention will finally be effected can be decided upon by the competent authorities of the Contracting States. For example, Contracting States may wish to use electronic or other communication and information technologies, including appropriate security systems, to improve the timeliness and quality of exchanges of information. Contracting States which are required, according to their law, to observe data protection laws, may wish to include provisions in their bilateral conventions concerning the protection of personal data exchanged. Data protection concerns the rights and fundamental freedoms of an individual, and in particular, the right to privacy, with regard to automatic processing of personal data. See, for example, the <em>Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data</em> of 28 January 1981.</p>
<p id="CO026-P010"><a href="#CO026-P010-R">(Amended on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>10.1  Before 2000, the paragraph only authorised the exchange of information, and the use of the information exchanged, in relation to the taxes covered by the Convention under the general rules of <a href="#A002">Article 2</a>. As drafted, the paragraph did not oblige the requested State to comply with a request for information concerning the imposition of a sales tax as such a tax was not covered by the Convention. The paragraph was then amended so as to apply to the exchange of information concerning any tax imposed on behalf of the Contracting States, or of their political subdivisions or local authorities, and to allow the use of the information exchanged for purposes of the application of all such taxes. Some Contracting States may not, however, be in a position to exchange information, or to use the information obtained from a treaty partner, in relation to taxes that are not covered by the Convention under the general rules of <a href="#A002">Article 2</a>. Such States are free to restrict the scope of <a href="#A002-P001">paragraph 1</a> of the Article to the taxes covered by the Convention.</p>

<p>10.2  In some cases, a Contracting State may need to receive information in a particular form to satisfy its evidentiary or other legal requirements. Such forms may include depositions of witnesses and authenticated copies of original records. Contracting States should endeavour as far as possible to accommodate such requests. Under <a href="#A026-P003">paragraph 3</a>, the requested State may decline to provide the information in the specific form requested if, for instance, the requested form is not known or permitted under its law or administrative practice. A refusal to provide the information in the form requested does not affect the obligation to provide the information.</p>
<p id="CO026-P010.02"><a href="#CO026-P010.02-R">(Added on 15 July 2005 see History)</a></p>
<p>10.3  Nothing in the Convention prevents the application of the provisions of the Article to the exchange of information that existed prior to the entry into force of the Convention, as long as the assistance with respect to this information is provided after the Convention has entered into force and the provisions of the Article have become effective. Contracting States may find it useful, however, to clarify the extent to which the provisions of the Article are applicable to such information, in particular when the provisions of that convention will have effect with respect to taxes arising or levied from a certain time.</p>
<p id="CO026-P010.03"><a href="#CO026-P010.03-R">(Added on 15 July 2005 see History)</a></p>
<p>10.4  Contracting States may wish to improve the speediness and timeliness of exchange of information under this Article by agreeing on time limits for the provision of information. Contracting States may do so by adding the following language to the Article:6.  The competent authorities of the Contracting States may agree on time limits for the provision of information under this Article. In the absence of such an agreement, the information shall be supplied as quickly as possible and, except where the delay is due to legal impediments, within the following time limits:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Where the tax authorities of the requested Contracting State are already in possession of the requested information, such information shall be supplied to the competent authority of the other Contracting State within two months of the receipt of the information request;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where the tax authorities of the requested Contracting State are not already in the possession of the requested information, such information shall be supplied to the competent authority of the other Contracting State within six months of the receipt of the information request.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p id="CO026-P010.04">Provided that the other conditions of this Article are met, information shall be considered to have been exchanged in accordance with the provisions of this Article even if it is supplied after these time limits.</p>
<p id=""><a href="#CO026-P010.04-R">(Added on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>10.5  The provisions in subparagraphs <em>a</em>) and <em>b</em>) of optional paragraph 6, referenced in <a href="#CO026-P010.04">paragraph 10.4</a>, set a default standard for time limits that would apply where the competent authorities have not made a different agreement on longer or shorter time limits. The default standard time limits are two months from the receipt of the information request if the requested information is already in the possession of the tax authorities of the requested Contracting State and six months in all other cases. Notwithstanding the default standard time limits or time limits otherwise agreed, competent authorities may come to different agreements on a case-by-case basis, for example, when they both agree more time is appropriate. This may arise where the request is complex in nature. In such a case, the competent authority of a requesting Contracting State should not unreasonably deny a request by the competent authority of a requested Contracting State for more time. If a requested Contracting State is unable to supply the requested information within the prescribed time limit because of legal impediments (for example, because of ongoing litigation regarding a taxpayer’s challenge to the validity of the request or ongoing litigation regarding a domestic notification procedure of the type described in <a href="#CO026-P014.01">paragraph 14.1</a>), it would not be in violation of the time limits.</p>

<p>10.6  The last sentence in optional paragraph 6, referenced in <a href="#CO026-P010.04">paragraph 10.4</a>, which provides “provided that the other conditions of this Article are met, information shall be considered to have been exchanged in accordance with the provisions of this Article even if it is supplied after these time limits” makes it clear that no objection to the use or admissibility of information exchanged under this Article can be based on the fact that the information was exchanged after the time limits agreed to by the competent authorities or the default time limits provided for in the paragraph.</p>

<p></paragraphsection><paragraphsection><title>Paragraph 2</title>11.  Reciprocal assistance between tax administrations is feasible only if each administration is assured that the other administration will treat with proper confidence the information which it will receive in the course of their co-operation. The confidentiality rules of <a href="#A026-P002">paragraph 2</a> apply to all types of information received under <a href="#A026-P001">paragraph 1</a>, including both information provided in a request and information transmitted in response to a request. Hence, the confidentiality rules cover, for instance, competent authority letters, including the letter requesting information. At the same time, it is understood that the requested State can disclose the minimum information contained in a competent authority letter (but not the letter itself) necessary for the requested State to be able to obtain or provide the requested information to the requesting State, without frustrating the efforts of the requesting State. If, however, court proceedings or the like under the domestic laws of the requested State necessitate the disclosure of the competent authority letter itself, the competent authority of the requested State may disclose such a letter unless the requesting State otherwise specifies. The maintenance of secrecy in the receiving Contracting State is a matter of domestic laws. It is therefore provided in <a href="#A026-P002">paragraph 2</a> that information communicated under the provisions of the Convention shall be treated as secret in the receiving State in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State. Sanctions for the violation of such secrecy in that State will be governed by the administrative and penal laws of that State. In situations in which the requested State determines that the requesting State does not comply with its duties regarding the confidentiality of the information exchanged under this Article, the requested State may suspend assistance under this Article until such time as proper assurance is given by the requesting State that those duties will indeed be respected. If necessary, the competent authorities may enter into specific arrangements or memoranda of understanding regarding the confidentiality of the information exchanged under this Article.</p>

This means that the information may also be communicated to the taxpayer, his proxy or to the witnesses. This also means that information can be disclosed to governmental or judicial authorities charged with deciding whether such information should be released to the taxpayer, his proxy or to the witnesses. The information received by a Contracting State may be used by such persons or authorities only for the purposes mentioned in <a href="#A026-P002">paragraph 2</a> Furthermore, information covered by <a href="#A026-P001">paragraph 1</a>, whether taxpayer-specific or not, should not be disclosed to persons or authorities not mentioned in <a href="#A026-P002">paragraph 2</a>, regardless of domestic information disclosure laws such as freedom of information or other legislation that allows greater access to governmental documents.</p>

<p>12.1  Information can also be disclosed to oversight bodies. Such oversight bodies include authorities that supervise tax administration and enforcement authorities as part of the general administration of the Government of a Contracting State. In their bilateral negotiations, however, Contracting States may depart from this principle and agree to exclude the disclosure of information to such supervisory bodies.</p>

<p>12.3  Information exchanged for tax purposes may be of value to the receiving State for purposes in addition to those referred to in the first and second sentences of <a href="#A026-P002">paragraph 2</a> of Article 26. The last sentence of <a href="#A026-P002">paragraph 2</a> therefore allows the Contracting States to share information received for tax purposes provided two conditions are met: first, the information may be used for other purposes under the laws of both States and, second, the competent authority of the supplying State authorises such use. It allows the sharing of tax information by the tax authorities of the receiving State with other law enforcement agencies and judicial authorities in that State on certain high priority matters (e.g.to combat money laundering, corruption, terrorism financing). When a receiving State desires to use the information for an additional purpose (i.e.non-tax purpose), the receiving State should specify to the supplying State the other purpose for which it wishes to use the information and confirm that the receiving State can use the information for such other purpose under its laws. Where the supplying State is in a position to do so, having regard to, amongst others, international agreements or other arrangements between the Contracting States relating to mutual assistance between other law enforcement agencies and judicial authorities, the competent authority of the supplying State would generally be expected to authorise such use for other purposes if the information can be used for similar purposes in the supplying State. Law enforcement agencies and judicial authorities receiving information under the last sentence of <a href="#A026-P002">paragraph 2</a> must treat that information as confidential consistent with the principles of <a href="#A026-P002">paragraph 2</a>.</p>

<p id="">12.4  It is recognised that Contracting States may wish to achieve the overall objective inherent in the last sentence of <a href="#A026-P002">paragraph 2</a> in other ways and they may do so by replacing the last sentence of <a href="#A026-P002">paragraph 2</a> with the following text:The competent authority of the Contracting State that receives information under the provisions of this Article may, with the written consent of the Contracting State that provided the information, also make available that information to be used for other purposes allowed under the provisions of a mutual legal assistance treaty in force between the Contracting States that allows for the exchange of tax information.</p>

<p>13.  As stated in <a href="#CO026-P012">paragraph 12</a>, the information obtained can be communicated to the persons and authorities mentioned and on the basis of the third sentence of <a href="#A026-P002">paragraph 2</a> of the Article can be disclosed by them in court sessions held in public or in decisions which reveal the name of the taxpayer. Once information is used in public court proceedings or in court decisions and thus rendered public, it is clear that from that moment such information can be quoted from the court files or decisions for other purposes even as possible evidence. But this does not mean that the persons and authorities mentioned in <a href="#A026-P002">paragraph 2</a> are allowed to provide on request additional information received. If either or both of the Contracting States object to the information being made public by courts in this way, or, once the information has been made public in this way, to the information being used for other purposes, because this is not the normal procedure under their domestic laws, they should state this expressly in their convention.</p>

<p></paragraphsection><paragraphsection><title>Paragraph 3</title>14.  This paragraph contains certain limitations to the main rule in favour of the requested State. In the first place, the paragraph contains the clarification that a Contracting State is not bound to go beyond its own internal laws and administrative practice in putting information at the disposal of the other Contracting State. However, internal provisions concerning tax secrecy should not be interpreted as constituting an obstacle to the exchange of information under the present Article. As mentioned above, the authorities of the requesting State are obliged to observe secrecy with regard to information received under this Article.</p>
<p id="CO026-P014"><a href="#CO026-P014-R">(Amended on 15 July 2005 see History)</a></p>
<p>14.1  Some countries’ laws include procedures for notifying the person who provided the information and/or the taxpayer that is subject to the enquiry prior to the supply of information. Such notification procedures may be an important aspect of the rights provided under domestic law. They can help prevent mistakes (e.g.in cases of mistaken identity) and facilitate exchange (by allowing taxpayers who are notified to co-operate voluntarily with the tax authorities in the requesting State). Notification procedures should not, however, be applied in a manner that, in the particular circumstances of the request, would frustrate the efforts of the requesting State. In other words, they should not prevent or unduly delay effective exchange of information. For instance, notification procedures should permit exceptions from prior notification,e.g.in cases in which the information request is of a very urgent nature or the notification is likely to undermine the chance of success of the investigation conducted by the requesting State. A Contracting State that under its domestic law is required to notify the person who provided the information and/or the taxpayer that an exchange of information is proposed should inform its treaty partners in writing that it has this requirement and what the consequences are for its obligations in relation to mutual assistance. Such information should be provided to the other Contracting State when a convention is concluded and thereafter whenever the relevant rules are modified.</p>
<p id="CO026-P014.01"><a href="#CO026-P014.01-R">(Added on 15 July 2005 see History)</a></p>
<p>15.  Furthermore, the requested State does not need to go so far as to carry out administrative measures that are not permitted under the laws or practice of the requesting State or to supply items of information that are not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of administration of the requesting State. It follows that a Contracting State cannot take advantage of the information system of the other Contracting State if it is wider than its own system. Thus, a State may refuse to provide information where the requesting State would be precluded by law from obtaining or providing the information or where the requesting State’s administrative practices (e.g.failure to provide sufficient administrative resources) result in a lack of reciprocity. However, it is recognised that too rigorous an application of the principle of reciprocity could frustrate effective exchange of information and that reciprocity should be interpreted in a broad and pragmatic manner. Different countries will necessarily have different mechanisms for obtaining and providing information. Variations in practices and procedures should not be used as a basis for denying a request unless the effect of these variations would be to limit in a significant way the requesting State’s overall ability to obtain and provide the information if the requesting State itself received a legitimate request from the requested State. It is worth noting that if a Contracting State applies, under <a href="#A026-P005">paragraph 5</a>, measures not normally foreseen in its domestic law or practice, such as to access and exchange bank information, that State is equally entitled to request similar information from the other Contracting State. This would be fully in line with the principle of reciprocity which underlies subparagraphs <em>a</em>) and <em>b</em>) of <a href="#A026-P003">paragraph 3</a>.</p>
<p id="CO026-P015"><a href="#CO026-P015-R">(Amended on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>15.1  The principle of reciprocity has no application where the legal system or administrative practice of only one country provides for a specific procedure. For instance, a country requested to provide information could not point to the absence of a ruling regime in the country requesting information and decline to provide information on a ruling it has granted, based on a reciprocity argument. Of course, where the requested information itself is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administrative practice of the requesting State, a requested State may decline such a request.</p>
<p id="CO026-P015.01"><a href="#CO026-P015.01-R">(Added on 15 July 2005 see History)</a></p>
<p>15.2  Most countries recognise under their domestic laws that information cannot be obtained from a person to the extent that such person can claim the privilege against self-incrimination. A requested State may, therefore, decline to provide information if the requesting State would have been precluded by its own self-incrimination rules from obtaining the information under similar circumstances. In practice, however, the privilege against self-incrimination should have little, if any, application in connection with most information requests. The privilege against self-incrimination is personal and cannot be claimed by an individual who himself is not at risk of criminal prosecution. The overwhelming majority of information requests seek to obtain information from third parties such as banks, intermediaries or the other party to a contract and not from the individual under investigation. Furthermore, the privilege against self-incrimination generally does not attach to persons other than natural persons.</p>
<p id="CO026-P015.02"><a href="#CO026-P015.02-R">(Added on 15 July 2005 see History)</a></p>
<p>16.  Information is deemed to be obtainable in the normal course of administration if it is in the possession of the tax authorities or can be obtained by them in the normal procedure of tax determination, which may include special investigations or special examination of the business accounts kept by the taxpayer or other persons, provided that the tax authorities would make similar investigations or examinations for their own purposes. The paragraph assumes, of course, that tax authorities have the powers and resources necessary to facilitate effective information exchange. For instance, assume that a Contracting State requests information in connection with an investigation into the tax affairs of a particular taxpayer and specifies in the request that the information might be held by one of a few service providers identified in the request and established in the other Contracting State. In this case, the requested State would be expected to be able to obtain and provide such information to the extent that such information is held by one of the service providers identified in the request. In responding to a request the requested State should be guided by the overarching purpose of <a href="#A026">Article 26</a> which is to permit information exchange “to the widest possible extent” and may consider the importance of the requested information to the requesting State in relation to the administrative burden for the requested State.</p>

<p>16.1  Subparagraphs <em>a</em>) and <em>b</em>) of paragraph 3 do not permit the requested State to decline a request where <a href="#A026-P004">paragraph 4</a> or <a href="#A026-P005">5</a> applies. <a href="#A026-P005">Paragraph 5</a> would apply, for instance, in situations in which the requested State’s inability to obtain the information was specifically related to the fact that the requested information was believed to be held by a bank or other financial institution. Thus, the application of <a href="#A026-P005">paragraph 5</a> includes situations in which the tax authorities’ information gathering powers with respect to information held by banks and other financial institutions are subject to different requirements than those that are generally applicable with respect to information held by persons other than banks or other financial institutions. This would, for example, be the case where the tax authorities can only exercise their information gathering powers with respect to information held by banks and other financial institutions in instances where specific information on the taxpayer under examination or investigation is available. This would also be the case where, for example, the use of information gathering measures with respect to information held by banks and other financial institutions requires a higher probability that the information requested is held by the person believed to be in possession of the requested information than the degree of probability required for the use of information gathering measures with respect to information believed to be held by persons other than banks or financial institutions.</p>

<p>17.  The requested State is at liberty to refuse to give information in the cases referred to in the paragraphs above. However if it does give the requested information, it remains within the framework of the agreement on the exchange of information which is laid down in the Convention; consequently it cannot be objected that this State has failed to observe the obligation to secrecy.</p>
<p id="CO026-P017"><a href="#CO026-P017-R">(Added on 11 April 1977 see History)</a></p>
<p>18.  If the structure of the information systems of two Contracting States is very different, the conditions under subparagraphs <em>a)</em> and <em>b)</em> of <a href="#A026-P003">paragraph 3</a> will lead to the result that the Contracting States exchange very little information or perhaps none at all. In such a case, the Contracting States may find it appropriate to broaden the scope of the exchange of information.</p>
<p id="CO026-P018"><a href="#CO026-P018-R">(Amended on 15 July 2005 see History)</a></p>
<p>18.1  Unless otherwise agreed to by the Contracting States, it can be assumed that the requested information could be obtained by the requesting State in a similar situation if that State has not indicated to the contrary.</p>

<p>19.  In addition to the limitations referred to above, subparagraph <em>c)</em> of <a href="#A026-P003">paragraph 3</a> contains a reservation concerning the disclosure of certain secret information. Secrets mentioned in this subparagraph should not be taken in too wide a sense. Before invoking this provision, a Contracting State should carefully weigh if the interests of the taxpayer really justify its application. Otherwise it is clear that too wide an interpretation would in many cases render ineffective the exchange of information provided for in the Convention. The observations made in <a href="#CO026-P017">paragraph 17</a> above apply here as well. The requested State in protecting the interests of its taxpayers is given a certain discretion to refuse the requested information, but if it does supply the information deliberately the taxpayer cannot allege an infraction of the rules of secrecy.</p>
<p id="CO026-P019"><a href="#CO026-P019-R">(Amended on 15 July 2005 see History)</a></p>
<p>19.1  In its deliberations regarding the application of secrecy rules, the Contracting State should also take into account the confidentiality rules of <a href="#A026-P002">paragraph 2</a> of the Article. The domestic laws and practices of the requesting State together with the obligations imposed under <a href="#A026-P002">paragraph 2</a>, may ensure that the information cannot be used for the types of unauthorised purposes against which the trade or other secrecy rules are intended to protect. Thus, a Contracting State may decide to supply the information where it finds that there is no reasonable basis for assuming that a taxpayer involved may suffer any adverse consequences incompatible with information exchange.</p>
<p id="CO026-P019.01"><a href="#CO026-P019.01-R">(Added on 15 July 2005 see History)</a></p>
<p>19.2  In most cases of information exchange no issue of trade, business or other secret will arise. A trade or business secret is generally understood to mean facts and circumstances that are of considerable economic importance and that can be exploited practically and the unauthorised use of which may lead to serious damage (e.g.may lead to severe financial hardship). The determination, assessment or collection of taxes as such could not be considered to result in serious damage. Financial information, including books and records, does not by its nature constitute a trade, business or other secret. In certain limited cases, however, the disclosure of financial information might reveal a trade, business or other secret. For instance, a request for information on certain purchase records may raise such an issue if the disclosure of such information revealed the proprietary formula used in the manufacture of a product. The protection of such information may also extend to information in the possession of third persons. For instance, a bank might hold a pending patent application for safe keeping or a secret trade process or formula might be described in a loan application or in a contract held by a bank. In such circumstances, details of the trade, business or other secret should be excised from the documents and the remaining financial information exchanged accordingly.</p>

<p>19.3  A requested State may decline to disclose information relating to confidential communications between attorneys, solicitors or other admitted legal representatives in their role as such and their clients to the extent that the communications are protected from disclosure under domestic law. However, the scope of protection afforded to such confidential communications should be narrowly defined. Such protection does not attach to documents or records delivered to an attorney, solicitor or other admitted legal representative in an attempt to protect such documents or records from disclosure required by law. Also, information on the identity of a person such as a director or beneficial owner of a company is typically not protected as a confidential communication. Whilst the scope of protection afforded to confidential communications might differ among states, it should not be overly broad so as to hamper effective exchange of information. Communications between attorneys, solicitors or other admitted legal representatives and their clients are only confidential if, and to the extent that, such representatives act in their capacity as attorneys, solicitors or other admitted legal representatives and not in a different capacity, such as nominee shareholders, trustees, settlors, company directors or under a power of attorney to represent a company in its business affairs. An assertion that information is protected as a confidential communication between an attorney, solicitor or other admitted legal representative and its client should be adjudicated exclusively in the Contracting State under the laws of which it arises. Thus, it is not intended that the courts of the requested State should adjudicate claims based on the laws of the requesting State.</p>
<p id="CO026-P019.03"><a href="#CO026-P019.03-R">(Added on 15 July 2005 see History)</a></p>
<p>19.4  Contracting States wishing to refer expressly to the protection afforded to confidential communications between a client and an attorney, solicitor or other admitted legal representative may do so by adding the following text at the end of <a href="#A026-P003">paragraph 3</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>to obtain or provide information which would reveal confidential communications between a client and an attorney, solicitor or other admitted legal representative where such communications are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>produced for the purposes of seeking or providing legal advice or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>produced for the purposes of use in existing or contemplated legal proceedings.</p>

<p>19.5  <a href="#A026-P003">Paragraph 3</a> also includes a limitation with regard to information which concerns the vital interests of the State itself. To this end, it is stipulated that Contracting States do not have to supply information the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public). However, this limitation should only become relevant in extreme cases. For instance, such a case could arise if a tax investigation in the requesting State were motivated by political, racial, or religious persecution. The limitation may also be invoked where the information constitutes a state secret, for instance sensitive information held by secret services the disclosure of which would be contrary to the vital interests of the requested State. Thus, issues of public policy (ordre public) rarely arise in the context of information exchange between treaty partners.</p>
<p id="CO026-P019.05"><a href="#CO026-P019.05-R">(Added on 15 July 2005 see History)</a></p>
<p></paragraphsection><paragraphsection><title>Paragraph 4</title>19.6  <a href="#A026-P004">Paragraph 4</a> was added in 2005 to deal explicitly with the obligation to exchange information in situations where the requested information is not needed by the requested State for domestic tax purposes. Prior to the addition of <a href="#A026-P004">paragraph 4</a> this obligation was not expressly stated in the Article, but was clearly evidenced by the practices followed by member countries which showed that, when collecting information requested by a treaty partner, Contracting States often use the special examining or investigative powers provided by their laws for purposes of levying their domestic taxes even though they do not themselves need the information for these purposes. This principle is also stated in the report <em>Improving Access to Bank Information for Tax Purposes</em>.[^84] </p>
<p id="CO026-P019.06"><a href="#CO026-P019.06-R">(Added on 15 July 2005 see History)</a></p>
<p>19.7  According to <a href="#A026-P004">paragraph 4</a>, Contracting States must use their information gathering measures, even though invoked solely to provide information to the other Contracting State and irrespective of whether the information could still be gathered or used for domestic tax purposes in the requested Contracting State. Thus, for instance, any restrictions on the ability of a requested Contracting State to obtain information from a person for domestic tax purposes at the time of a request (for example, because of the expiration of a statute of limitations under the requested State’s domestic law or the prior completion of an audit) must not restrict its ability to use its information gathering measures for information exchange purposes. The term “information gathering measures” means laws and administrative or judicial procedures that enable a Contracting State to obtain and provide the requested information. <a href="#A026-P004">Paragraph 4</a> does not oblige a requested Contracting State to provide information in circumstances where it has attempted to obtain the requested information but finds that the information no longer exists following the expiration of a domestic record retention period. However, where the requested information is still available notwithstanding the expiration of such retention period, the requested State cannot decline to exchange the information available. Contracting States should ensure that reliable accounting records are kept for five years or more.</p>
<p id="CO026-P019.07"><a href="#CO026-P019.07-R">(Amended on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>19.8  The second sentence of <a href="#A026-P004">paragraph 4</a> makes clear that the obligation contained in paragraph 4 is subject to the limitations of <a href="#A026-P003">paragraph 3</a> but also provides that such limitations cannot be construed to form the basis for declining to supply information where a country’s laws or practices include a domestic tax interest requirement. Thus, whilst a requested State cannot invoke <a href="#A026-P003">paragraph 3</a> and argue that under its domestic laws or practices it only supplies information in which it has an interest for its own tax purposes, it may, for instance, decline to supply the information to the extent that the provision of the information would disclose a trade secret.</p>
<p id="CO026-P019.08"><a href="#CO026-P019.08-R">(Added on 15 July 2005 see History)</a></p>
<p id="">19.9  For many countries the combination of <a href="#A026-P004">paragraph 4</a> and their domestic law provide a sufficient basis for using their information gathering measures to obtain the requested information even in the absence of a domestic tax interest in the information. Other countries, however, may wish to clarify expressly in the convention that Contracting States must ensure that their competent authorities have the necessary powers to do so. Contracting States wishing to clarify this point may replace <a href="#A026-P004">paragraph 4</a> with the following text:4.  In order to effectuate the exchange of information as provided in <a href="#A026-P001">paragraph 1</a>, each Contracting State shall take the necessary measures, including legislation, rule-making, or administrative arrangements, to ensure that its competent authority has sufficient powers under its domestic law to obtain information for the exchange of information regardless of whether that Contracting State may need such information for its own tax purposes.</p>
<p id="CO026-P019.09"><a href="#CO026-P019.09-R">(Added on 15 July 2005 see History)</a></p>
<p></paragraphsection><paragraphsection><title>Paragraph 5</title>19.10  <a href="#A026-P001">Paragraph 1</a> imposes a positive obligation on a Contracting State to exchange all types of information. <a href="#A026-P005">Paragraph 5</a> is intended to ensure that the limitations of <a href="#A026-P003">paragraph 3</a> cannot be used to prevent the exchange of information held by banks, other financial institutions, nominees, agents and fiduciaries as well as ownership information. Whilst <a href="#A026-P005">paragraph 5</a>, which was added in 2005, represents a change in the structure of the Article, it should not be interpreted as suggesting that the previous version of the Article did not authorise the exchange of such information. The vast majority of OECD member countries already exchanged such information under the previous version of the Article and the addition of <a href="#A026-P005">paragraph 5</a> merely reflects current practice.</p>
<p id="CO026-P019.10"><a href="#CO026-P019.10-R">(Added on 15 July 2005 see History)</a></p>
<p>19.11  <a href="#A026-P005">Paragraph 5</a> stipulates that a Contracting State shall not decline to supply information to a treaty partner solely because the information is held by a bank or other financial institution. Thus, <a href="#A026-P005">paragraph 5</a> overrides <a href="#A026-P003">paragraph 3</a> to the extent that <a href="#A026-P003">paragraph 3</a> would otherwise permit a requested Contracting State to decline to supply information on grounds of bank secrecy. The addition of this paragraph to the Article reflects the international trend in this area as reflected in the <em>Model Agreement on Exchange of Information on Tax Matters</em> and as described in the report, <em>Improving Access to Bank Information for Tax Purposes.</em> [^85] In accordance with that report, access to information held by banks or other financial institutions may be by direct means or indirectly through a judicial or administrative process. The procedure for indirect access should not be so burdensome and time-consuming as to act as an impediment to access to bank information.</p>
<p id="CO026-P019.11"><a href="#CO026-P019.11-R">(Amended on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>19.12  <a href="#A026-P005">Paragraph 5</a> also provides that a Contracting State shall not decline to supply information solely because the information is held by persons acting in an agency or fiduciary capacity. For instance, if a Contracting State had a law under which all information held by a fiduciary was treated as a “professional secret” merely because it was held by a fiduciary, such State could not use such law as a basis for declining to provide the information to the other Contracting State. A person is generally said to act in a “fiduciary capacity” when the business which the person transacts, or the money or property which the person handles, is not its own or for its own benefit, but for the benefit of another person as to whom the fiduciary stands in a relation implying and necessitating confidence and trust on the one part and good faith on the other part, such as a trustee. The term “agency” is very broad and includes all forms of corporate service providers (e.g.company formation agents, trust companies, registered agents, lawyers).</p>

<p>19.13  Finally, <a href="#A026-P005">paragraph 5</a> states that a Contracting State shall not decline to supply information solely because it relates to an ownership interest in a person, including companies and partnerships, foundations or similar organisational structures. Information requests cannot be declined merely because domestic laws or practices may treat ownership information as a trade or other secret.</p>
<p id="CO026-P019.13"><a href="#CO026-P019.13-R">(Added on 15 July 2005 see History)</a></p>
<p>19.14  <a href="#A026-P005">Paragraph 5</a> does not preclude a Contracting State from invoking <a href="#A026-P003">paragraph 3</a> to refuse to supply information held by a bank, financial institution, a person acting in an agency or fiduciary capacity or information relating to ownership interests. However, such refusal must be based on reasons unrelated to the person’s status as a bank, financial institution, agent, fiduciary or nominee, or the fact that the information relates to ownership interests. For instance, a legal representative acting for a client may be acting in an agency capacity but for any information protected as a confidential communication between attorneys, solicitors or other admitted legal representatives and their clients, <a href="#A026-P003">paragraph 3</a> continues to provide a possible basis for declining to supply the information.</p>

<p>19.15  The following examples illustrate the application of <a href="#A026-P005">paragraph 5</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Company X owns a majority of the stock in a subsidiary company Y, and both companies are incorporated under the laws of State A. State B is conducting a tax examination of business operations of company Y in State B. In the course of this examination the question of both direct and indirect ownership in company Y becomes relevant and State B makes a request to State A for ownership information of any person in company Y’s chain of ownership. In its reply State A should provide to State B ownership information for both company X and Y.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An individual subject to tax in State A maintains a bank account with Bank B in State B. State A is examining the income tax return of the individual and makes a request to State B for all bank account income and asset information held by Bank B in order to determine whether there were deposits of untaxed earned income. State B should provide the requested bank information to State A.</p>

<p></observations><strong>HISTORY</strong></p>
<p id=""><strong>Title:</strong> Amended, by inserting the word “THE”, when the 1977 Model Convention was adopted by the OECD Council on 11 April 1977. In the 1963 Draft Convention (adopted by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963) and until the adoption of the 1977 Model Convention, the title read as follows:1  “COMMENTARY ON ARTICLE 26 CONCERNING EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION”</p>
<p id=""><strong><a href="#CO026-P001">Paragraph 1</a></strong>: Replaced together with the preceding heading when the 1977 Model Convention was adopted by the OECD Council on 11 April 1977. At that time, paragraph 1 the 1963 Draft Convention was deleted and a new paragraph was added. In the 1963 Draft Convention (adopted by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963) and until the adoption of the 1977 Model Convention, paragraph 1 and the preceding heading read as follows:“I.  GENERAL OBSERVATIONS</p>
<p id="">1.  The application of a Convention for the avoidance of double taxation implies a cooperation between the tax administrations of the two Contracting States which may be more or less close according to the circumstances. An obvious instance is the administrative assistance in particular cases for purposes of ascertaining the facts in relation to which the national tax legislation and the rules of the Convention are to be applied. The present Article embodies the rules according to which information may be exchanged with a view to laying the proper basis for a taxation under the Convention.”</p>
<p id=""><strong><a href="#CO026-P002">Paragraph 2</a></strong>: Amended on 15 July 2005 by the report entitled “The 2005 Update to the Model Tax Convention”, adopted by the OECD Council on 15 July 2005, on the basis of another report entitled “Changes to Articles 25 and 26 of the Model Tax Convention” (adopted by the OECD Committee on Fiscal Affairs on 1 June 2004). In the 1977 Model Convention and until 15 July 2005, paragraph 2 read as follows:“2.  Therefore the present Article embodies the rules under which information may be exchanged to the widest possible extent, with a view to laying the proper basis for the implementation of the domestic laws of the Contracting States concerning taxes covered by the Convention and for the application of specific provisions of the Convention. The text of the Article makes it clear that the exchange of information is not restricted by Article 1, so that the information may include particulars about non-residents.”</p>
<p>Paragraph 2 of the 1963 Draft Convention was replaced when the 1977 Model Convention was adopted by the OECD Council on 11 April 1977. At that time, paragraph 2 of the 1963 Draft Convention was amended and renumbered as paragraph 3 (see history of paragraph 3) and a new paragraph 2 was added.</p>
<p id=""><strong><a href="#CO026-P003">Paragraph 3</a></strong>: Amended on 15 July 2014 by the Report entitled “The 2014 Update to the Model Tax Convention”, adopted by the Council of the OECD on 15 July 2014, on the basis of the report “Draft Amendments to Article 26 of the OECD Model Tax Convention and its Commentary”, adopted by the OECD Council on 17 July 2012 and applicable from that date. After 28 January 2003 and until 15 July 2014, paragraph 3 read as follows:“3.  The matter of administrative assistance for the purpose of tax collection is dealt with in Article 27.”</p>
<p id="">Paragraph 3 was replaced on 28 January 2003 when it was deleted and a new paragraph 3 was added by the report entitled “The 2002 Update to the Model Tax Convention”, adopted by the OECD Council on 28 January 2003. After 21 September 1995 and until 28 January 2003, paragraph 3 read as follows:“3.  The matter of administrative assistance for the purpose of tax collection is not dealt with in the Article. This matter is dealt with in the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, a multilateral convention that entered into force on 1 April 1995. This Convention was drawn up within the Council of Europe on the basis of a first draft prepared by the Committee on Fiscal Affairs and is open to the signature of the member States of the Council of Europe and member countries of the OECD. This matter can also form the subject of a separate bilateral agreement that can be negotiated between the Contracting States on the basis of the Model Convention for Mutual Administrative Assistance in the Recovery of Tax Claims adopted by the Committee on Fiscal Affairs on 29 June 1979; alternatively, provisions on assistance in the field of tax collection may be introduced in a double taxation convention, whenever Contracting States find it preferable.”</p>
<p id="">Paragraph 3 was amended on 21 September 1995, by replacing the words “which was opened for signature on 25 January 1988” with the words “that entered into force on 1 April 1995”, by the report entitled “The 1995 Update to the Model Tax Convention”, adopted by the OECD Council on 21 September 1995. After 23 July 1992 and until 21 September 1995, paragraph 3 read as follows:“3.  The matter of administrative assistance for the purpose of tax collection is not dealt with in the Article. This matter is dealt with in the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, a multilateral convention which was opened for signature on 25 January 1988. This Convention was drawn up within the Council of Europe on the basis of a first draft prepared by the Committee on Fiscal Affairs and is open to the signature of the member States of the Council of Europe and member countries of the OECD. This matter can also form the subject of a separate bilateral agreement that can be negotiated between the Contracting States on the basis of the Model Convention for Mutual Administrative Assistance in the Recovery of Tax Claims adopted by the Committee on Fiscal Affairs on 29 June 1979; alternatively, provisions on assistance in the field of tax collection may be introduced in a double taxation convention, whenever Contracting States find it preferable.”</p>
<p id="">Paragraph 3 was previously amended on 23 July 1992 by the report entitled “The Revision of the Model Convention”, adopted by the OECD Council on 23 July 1992. In the 1977 Model Convention and until 23 July 1992, paragraph 3 read as follows:“3.  The matter of administrative assistance for the purpose of tax collection is not dealt with in the Article. This matter often forms the subject of a separate agreement, whether bilateral or multilateral, between the Contracting States; alternatively, the provisions on assistance in the field of tax collection may be introduced in the double taxation convention, whenever Contracting States find it preferable.”</p>
<p id="">Paragraph 3 of the 1977 Model Convention corresponded to paragraph 2 of the 1963 Draft Convention. Paragraph 3 of the 1963 Draft Convention was amended and renumbered as paragraph 5 (see history of paragraph 5) when the 1977 Model Convention was adopted by the OECD Council on 11 April 1977. At the same time, paragraph 2 of the 1963 Draft Convention was amended and renumbered as paragraph 3 of the 1977 Model Convention. In the 1963 Draft Convention (adopted by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963) and until the adoption of the 1977 Model Convention, paragraph 2 read as follows:“2.  The matter of administrative assistance for the purpose of tax collection is not dealt with in the Article. This matter often forms the subject of a separate bilateral agreement between the Contracting States; alternatively, the provisions on assistance in the field of tax collection may be introduced in the double taxation Convention, whenever this is found preferable.”</p>
<p id=""><strong><a href="#CO026-P004">Paragraph 4</a></strong>: Amended on 15 July 2014, by deleting the first footnote and amending the second footnote, by the Report entitled “The 2014 Update to the Model Tax Convention”, adopted by the Council of the OECD on 15 July 2014. Those changes were made on the basis of the report “Draft Amendments to Article 26 of the OECD Model Tax Convention and its Commentary”, adopted by the OECD Council on 17 July 2012 and applicable from that date. After 15 July 2005 and until 15 July 2014, paragraph 4 read as follows:“4.  In 2002, the Committee on Fiscal Affairs undertook a comprehensive review of Article 26 to ensure that it reflects current country practices. That review also took into account recent developments such as the <em>Model Agreement on Exchange of Information on Tax Matters</em>1 developed by the OECD Global Forum Working Group on Effective Exchange of Information and the ideal standard of access to bank information as described in the report <em>Improving Access to Bank Information for Tax Purposes</em>.2 As a result, several changes to both the text of the Article and the Commentary were made in 2005.</p>

<p id="">Paragraph 4 was replaced on 15 July 2005 when it was deleted and a new paragraph 4 was added by the report entitled “The 2005 Update to the Model Tax Convention”, adopted by the OECD Council on 15 July 2005. Those changes were made on the basis of another report entitled “Changes to Articles 25 and 26 of the Model Tax Convention” (adopted by the OECD Committee on Fiscal Affairs on 1 June 2004). After 23 July 1992 and until 15 July 2005, paragraph 4 read as follows:“4.  Experience between 1963 and 1977 had shown that the text of the Article in the 1963 Draft Convention left room for differing interpretations. Therefore it was felt desirable to clarify its meaning in the 1977 Model Convention by a change in the wording of the Article and its Commentary without altering its effects. Apart from a single point of substance (see paragraph 13 below) the main purpose of the changes made has been to remove grounds for divergent interpretations.”</p>
<p id="">Paragraph 4 was amended on 23 July 1992 by the report entitled “The Revision of the Model Convention”, adopted by the OECD Council on 23 July 1992. In the 1977 Model Convention and until 23 July 1992, paragraph 4 read as follows:“4.  Experience in recent years has shown that the text of the Article in the 1963 Draft Convention left room for differing interpretations. Therefore it was felt desirable to clarify its meaning by a change in the wording of the Article and its Commentary without altering its effects. Apart from a single point of substance (see paragraph 13 below) the main purpose of the changes made has been to remove grounds for divergent interpretations.”</p>
<p id="">Paragraph 4 of the 1963 Draft Convention was replaced when the 1977 Model Convention was adopted on 11 April 1977. At that time, paragraph 4 of the 1963 Draft Convention was deleted and a new paragraph 4 was added. In the 1963 Draft Convention (adopted by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963) and until the adoption of the 1977 Model Convention, paragraph 4 read as follows:“4.  The following examples may illustrate the principle dealt with in paragraph 3 above. Thus, when applying the provisions of Article 12 on the taxation of royalties the competent authority of the State where the recipient is resident may find it necessary to request information from the competent authority of the State where the payer is resident, concerning the amount of royalty transmitted by the payer to the recipient. And vice versa, in determining the taxation of the payer, the competent authority of the State of the payer’s residence may have occasion to inquire, officially, about the identity of the recipient and if there exist between the payer and the recipient special relations which may be of relevance for the tax treatment. For this purpose, certain information is sometimes also of importance, such as information on prices quoted between two enterprises situated in two different Contracting States or between a permanent establishment in one country and its head office in another country. Generally, the exchange of information in this field will be needed with a view to properly allocating taxable profits between two associated enterprises or adjusting the amounts of profits shown in the accounts of a permanent establishment and in the accounts of its head office. As a further typical example reference may be made to the information necessary for the application of Article 23(A) and 23(B) on the methods for the avoidance of double taxation.”</p>
<p id=""><strong><a href="#CO026-P004.01">Paragraph 4.1</a></strong>: Amended on 15 July 2014 by the Report entitled “The 2014 Update to the Model Tax Convention”, adopted by the Council of the OECD on 15 July 2014, on the basis of the report “Draft Amendments to Article 26 of the OECD Model Tax Convention and its Commentary”, adopted by the OECD Council on 17 July 2012 and applicable from that date. After 15 July 2005 and until 15 July 2014, paragraph 4.1 read as follows:“4.1  Many of the changes that were then made to the Article were not intended to alter its substance, but instead were made to remove doubts as to its proper interpretation. For instance, the change from “necessary” to “foreseeably relevant” and the insertion of the words “to the administration or enforcement” in paragraph 1 were made to achieve consistency with the <em>Model Agreement on Exchange of Information on Tax Matters</em> and were not intended to alter the effect of the provision. New paragraph 4 was added to incorporate into the text of the Article the general understanding previously expressed in the Commentary (see paragraph 19.6). New paragraph 5 was added to reflect current practices among the vast majority of OECD member countries (see paragraph 19.15). The insertion of the words “or the oversight of the above” into new paragraph 2, on the other hand, constitutes a reversal of the previous rule.”</p>
<p>Paragraph 4.1 was added on 15 July 2005 by the report entitled “The 2005 Update to the Model Tax Convention”, adopted by the OECD Council on 15 July 2005, on the basis of another report entitled “Changes to Articles 25 and 26 of the Model Tax Convention” (adopted by the OECD Committee on Fiscal Affairs on 1 June 2004).</p>

After 15 July 2005 and until 15 July 2014, paragraph 4.2 read as follows:“4.2  The Commentary also has been expanded considerably. This expansion in part reflects the addition of new paragraph 4 and 5 to the Article. Other changes were made to the Commentary to take into account recent developments and current country practices and more generally to remove doubts as to the proper interpretation of the Article.”</p>
<p>Paragraph 4.2 was added on 15 July 2005 by the report entitled “The 2005 Update to the Model Tax Convention”, adopted by the OECD Council on 15 July 2005, on the basis of another report entitled “Changes to Articles 25 and 26 of the Model Tax Convention” (adopted by the OECD Committee on Fiscal Affairs on 1 June 2004).</p>

<p id=""><strong><a href="#CO026-P005">Paragraph 5</a></strong>: Amended on 15 July 2014, by replacing the 4th and subsequent sentences with new text. The 4th and subsequent sentences were incorporated into a new paragraph 5.3 (see history of paragraph 5.3). This amendment was made by the Report entitled “The 2014 Update to the Model Tax Convention”, adopted by the Council of the OECD on 15 July 2014, on the basis of the report “Draft Amendments to Article 26 of the OECD Model Tax Convention and its Commentary”, adopted by the OECD Council on 17 July 2012 and applicable from that date. After 15 July 2005 and until 15 July 2014, paragraph 5 read as follows:“5.  The main rule concerning the exchange of information is contained in the first sentence of the paragraph. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is foreseeably relevant to secure the correct application of the provisions of the Convention or of the domestic laws of the Contracting States concerning taxes of every kind and description imposed in these States even if, in the latter case, a particular Article of the Convention need not be applied. The standard of “foreseeable relevance” is intended to provide for exchange of information in tax matters to the widest possible extent and, at the same time, to clarify that Contracting States are not at liberty to engage in “fishing expeditions” or to request information that is unlikely to be relevant to the tax affairs of a given taxpayer. Contracting States may agree to an alternative formulation of this standard that is consistent with the scope of the Article (e.g.by replacing, “foreseeably relevant” with “necessary” or “relevant”). The scope of exchange of information covers all tax matters without prejudice to the general rules and legal provisions governing the rights of defendants and witnesses in judicial proceedings. Exchange of information for criminal tax matters can also be based on bilateral or multilateral treaties on mutual legal assistance (to the extent they also apply to tax crimes). In order to keep the exchange of information within the framework of the Convention, a limitation to the exchange of information is set so that information should be given only insofar as the taxation under the domestic taxation laws concerned is not contrary to the Convention.”</p>
<p id="">Paragraph 5 was previously amended on 15 July 2005 by the report entitled “The 2005 Update to the Model Tax Convention”, adopted by the OECD Council on 15 July 2005, on the basis of another report entitled “Changes to Articles 25 and 26 of the Model Tax Convention” (adopted by the OECD Committee on Fiscal Affairs on 1 June 2004). After 29 April 2000 and until 15 July 2005, paragraph 5 read as follows:“5.  The main rule concerning the exchange of information is contained in the first sentence of the paragraph. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is necessary to secure the correct application of the provisions of the Convention or of the domestic laws of the Contracting States concerning taxes of every kind and description imposed in these States even if, in the latter case, a particular Article of the Convention need not be applied. Some countries replace “necessary” with “relevant” in their bilateral conventions, regarding this as a better way to express the sense of the provision; in the view of the Committee on Fiscal Affairs, either word may be used in that context. In order to keep the exchange of information within the framework of the Convention, a limitation to the exchange of information is set so that information should be given only insofar as the taxation under the domestic taxation laws concerned is not contrary to the Convention.”</p>
<p id="">Paragraph 5 was previously amended on 29 April 2000 by the report entitled “The 2000 Update to the Model Tax Convention”, adopted by the OECD Committee on Fiscal Affairs on 29 April 2000.

Some countries replace “necessary” with “relevant” in their bilateral conventions, regarding this as a better way to express the sense of the provision; in the view of the Committee on Fiscal Affairs, either word may be used in that context. In order to keep the exchange of information within the framework of the Convention, a limitation to the exchange of information is set so that information should be given only insofar as the national tax in question is covered by the Convention and the taxation under the domestic taxation laws concerned is not contrary to the Convention. An illustration may be cited in this connection: a request for information concerning the imposition of a sales tax need not be complied with by the requested State as it is not covered by the Convention.”</p>
<p id="">Paragraph 5 was previously amended on 23 October 1997, by adding the third sentence, by the report entitled “The 1997 Update to the Model Tax Convention”, adopted by the OECD Council on 23 October 1997. In the 1977 Model Convention and until 23 October 1997, paragraph 5 read as follows:“5.  The main rule concerning the exchange of information is contained in the first sentence of the paragraph. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is necessary to secure the correct application of the provisions of the Convention or of the domestic laws of the Contracting States concerning taxes covered by the Convention even if, in the latter case, a particular Article of the Convention need not be applied.

In order to keep the exchange of information within the framework of the Convention, a limitation to the compulsory exchange of information is set so that information should be given only insofar as the national tax in question is covered by the Convention and the taxation under the national tax law concerned is in accordance with the Convention.”</p>
<p id="">Paragraph 5 of the 1963 Draft Convention was deleted when the 1977 Model Convention was adopted by the OECD Council on 11 April 1977.

The rule laid down in paragraph 1 of the Article presupposes that information shall be exchanged only on application. Obviously, the regular sources of information available to the responsible tax authority under the internal taxation procedure should be relied upon in the first place. Assistance under the present Article would therefore normally be requested when, in a particular case, the information obtained from the regularly available sources is insufficient or is in need of corroboration. In general, requests for assistance from the authorities of the co-Contracting State would have to be restricted to particulars which are required in connection with the examination of specific tax cases. Wide-ranging requests for information, concerning for example all payments of royalty made from one Contracting State to residents of the requiring State might, if the information is at all available, entail administrative difficulties and should be subjected to special agreements between the Contracting States.”</p>

Under the convention between A and B, State A, with a view to ensuring the correct application of the provisions of its domestic laws to the profits made by the company situated in its territory, asks State B what price the company in State B paid for the goods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State A, for the purpose of taxing a company situated in its territory, asks State B, under the convention between A and B, for information about the prices charged by a company in State B, or a group of companies in State B with which the company in State A has no business contacts in order to enable it to check the prices charged by the company in State A by direct comparison (e.g.prices charged by a company or a group of companies in a dominant position). It should be borne in mind that the exchange of information in this case might be a difficult and delicate matter owing in particular to the provisions of subparagraph <em>c)</em> of paragraph 2 relating to business and other secrets.”</p>

After 29 April 2000 and until 15 July 2005, paragraph 9.1 read as follows:“9.1  These three forms of exchange (on request, automatic and spontaneous) may also be combined. It should also be stressed that the Article does not restrict the possibilities of exchanging information to these methods and that the Contracting States may use other techniques to obtain information which may be relevant to both Contracting States such as simultaneous examinations, tax examinations abroad and industry-wide exchange of information. These techniques are fully described in the publication <em>Tax Information Exchange between OECD Member Countries: A Survey of Current Practices</em>  <a href="#d2e53217">2</a> and can be summarised as follows:<itemizedlist></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a simultaneous examination is an arrangement between two or more parties to examine simultaneously each in its own territory, the tax affairs of (a) taxpayer (s) in which they have a common or related interest, with a view of exchanging any relevant information which they so obtain (see the OECD Council Recommendation C(92)81, dated 23 July 1992, on an OECD Model agreement for the undertaking of simultaneous examinations);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a tax examination abroad allows for the possibility to obtain information through the presence of representatives of the competent authority of the requesting Contracting. This type of assistance is granted on a reciprocal basis. Countries’ laws and practices differ as to the scope of rights granted to foreign tax officials. For instance, there are States where a foreign tax official will be prevented from any active participation in an investigation or examination on the territory of a country; there are also States where such participation is only possible with the taxpayer’s consent;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an industry-wide exchange of information is the exchange of tax information especially concerning a whole economic sector (e.g.the oil or pharmaceutical industry, the banking sector, etc.) and not taxpayers in particular.</p>

For example, Contracting States may wish to use electronic or other communication and information technologies, including appropriate security systems, to improve the timeliness and quality of exchanges of information. Contracting States which are required, according to their law, to observe data protection laws, may wish to include provisions in their bilateral conventions concerning the protection of personal data exchanged. Data protection concerns the rights and fundamental freedoms of an individual, and in particular, the right to privacy, with regard to automatic processing of personal data.

As drafted, the paragraph did not oblige the requested State to comply with a request for information concerning the imposition of a sales tax as such a tax was not covered by the Convention. The paragraph was then amended so as to apply to the exchange of information concerning any tax imposed on behalf of the Contracting States, or of their political subdivisions or local authorities, and to allow the use of the information exchanged for purposes of the application of all such taxes. Some Contracting States may not, however, be in a position to exchange information, or to use the information obtained from a treaty partner, in relation to taxes that are not covered by the Convention under the general rules of Article 2. Such States are free to restrict the scope of paragraph 1 of Article 26 by adopting bilaterally the following previous wording of the paragraph:“1.  The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is necessary for carrying out the provisions of this Convention or of the domestic laws of the Contracting States concerning taxes covered by the Convention insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to the Convention. The exchange of information is not restricted by Article 1. Any information received by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, or the determination of appeals in relation to, the taxes covered by the Convention. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions.”</p>

After 15 July 2005 and until 15 July 2014, paragraph 13 read as follows:“13.  As stated in paragraph 12, the information obtained can be communicated to the persons and authorities mentioned and on the basis of the last sentence of paragraph 2 of the Article can be disclosed by them in court sessions held in public or in decisions which reveal the name of the taxpayer. Once information is used in public court proceedings or in court decisions and thus rendered public, it is clear that from that moment such information can be quoted from the court files or decisions for other purposes even as possible evidence. But this does not mean that the persons and authorities mentioned in paragraph 2 are allowed to provide on request additional information received. If either or both of the Contracting States object to the information being made public by courts in this way, or, once the information has been made public in this way, to the information being used for other purposes, because this is not the normal procedure under their domestic laws, they should state this expressly in their convention.”</p>

In the 1977 Model Convention and until 15 July 2005, paragraph 13 read as follows:“13.  As stated above, the information obtained can be communicated to the persons and authorities mentioned but it does not follow from this that it can be disclosed by them in court sessions held in public or in decisions which reveal the name of the taxpayer. The last sentence of the paragraph, however, opens up this possibility. Once information is used in public court proceedings or in court decisions and thus rendered public, it is clear that from that moment such information can be quoted from the court files or decisions for other purposes even as possible evidence. But this does not mean that the persons and authorities mentioned in paragraph 1 are allowed to provide on request additional information received.

<p>Paragraph 13 of the 1963 Draft Convention was replaced when the 1977 Model Convention was adopted by the OECD Council on 11 April 1977. At that time, paragraph 13 of the 1963 Draft Convention was amended and renumbered as paragraph 19 (see history of paragraph 19) and a new paragraph 13 was added.</p>

After 21 September 1995 and until 15 July 2005, paragraph 14 and the heading preceding it read as follows:<paragraphsection><title>“Paragraph 2</title>14.  This paragraph contains certain limitations to the main rule in favour of the requested State. In the first place, the paragraph contains the clarification that a Contracting State is not bound to go beyond its own internal laws and administrative practice in putting information at the disposal of the other Contracting State. However, types of administrative measures authorised for the purpose of the requested State’s tax must be utilised, even though invoked solely to provide information to the other Contracting State. Likewise, internal provisions concerning tax secrecy should not be interpreted as constituting an obstacle to the exchange of information under the present Article. As mentioned above, the authorities of the requesting State are obliged to observe secrecy with regard to information received under this Article. A Contracting State that under its domestic law is required to notify the taxpayer that an exchange of information is proposed should inform its treaty partners in writing that it has this requirement and what the consequences are for its obligations in relation to mutual assistance.”</p>

<p id="">Paragraph 14 was previously amended on 21 September 1995, by adding the last sentence, by the report entitled “The 1995 Update to the Model Tax Convention”, adopted by the OECD Council on 21 September 1995.

At the same time, paragraph 10 of the 1963 Draft Convention was amended and renumbered as paragraph 14 and the preceding heading was moved with it. In the 1963 Draft Convention (adopted by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963) and until the adoption of the 1977 Model Convention, paragraph 10 read as follows:“10.

After 15 July 2005 and until 15 July 2014, paragraph 15 read as follows:“15.  Furthermore, the requested State does not need to go so far as to carry out administrative measures that are not permitted under the laws or practice of the requesting State or to supply items of information that are not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of administration of the requesting State. It follows that a Contracting State cannot take advantage of the information system of the other Contracting State if it is wider than its own system. Thus, a State may refuse to provide information where the requesting State would be precluded by law from obtaining or providing the information or where the requesting State’s administrative practices (e.g.failure to provide sufficient administrative resources) result in a lack of reciprocity. However, it is recognised that too rigorous an application of the principle of reciprocity could frustrate effective exchange of information and that reciprocity should be interpreted in a broad and pragmatic manner. Different countries will necessarily have different mechanisms for obtaining and providing information. Variations in practices and procedures should not be used as a basis for denying a request unless the effect of these variations would be to limit in a significant way the requesting State’s overall ability to obtain and provide the information if the requesting State itself received a legitimate request from the requested State.”</p>
<p id="">Paragraph 15 was previously amended on 15 July 2005 by the report entitled “The 2005 Update to the Model Tax Convention”, adopted by the OECD Council on 15 July 2005, on the basis of another report entitled “Changes to Articles 25 and 26 of the Model Tax Convention” (adopted by the OECD Committee on Fiscal Affairs on 1 June 2004).

Paragraph 11 of the 1963 Draft Convention was amended and renumbered as paragraph 15 when the 1977 Model Convention was adopted by the OECD Council on 11 April 1977. In the 1963 Draft Convention (adopted by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963) and until the adoption of the 1977 Model Convention, paragraph 11 read as follows:“11.  Furthermore, since the main rule on exchange of information is based on the general principle of reciprocity, a Contracting State is not obliged to carry out administrative measures that are not permitted under the laws or practice of the requiring State or to supply items of information that are not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of administration of the requiring State. It follows that a Contracting State cannot take advantage of the information system of the other Contracting State if it is wider than its own system. On the other side, if the structure of the information systems of two Contracting States is very different, the conditions under sub-paragraphs a) and b) will allow the Contracting States to exchange very little information or perhaps none at all. In such a case, the Contracting States may find it appropriate to modify the principle of reciprocity by means of an understanding reached on the basis of Article 25 on mutual agreement procedure.”</p>

This means that the requested State has to collect the information the other State needs in the same way as if its own taxation was involved, under the proviso mentioned in paragraph 15 above. This obligation is clearly evidenced by the practices followed by member countries which show that, when collecting information requested by a treaty partner, Contracting States often use the special examining or investigative powers provided by their laws for purposes of the application of their domestic taxes even though they do not themselves need the information for applying these taxes.”</p>
<p id="">Paragraph 16 was previously amended on 28 January 2003 by the report entitled “The 2002 Update to the Model Tax Convention”, adopted by the OECD Council on 28 January 2003.

In addition to the limitations referred to above, subparagraph <em>c)</em> of paragraph 2 contains a reservation concerning the disclosure of certain secret information. Secrets mentioned in this subparagraph should not be taken in too wide a sense. Before invoking this provision, a Contracting State should carefully weigh if the interests of the taxpayer really justify its application. Otherwise it is clear that too wide an interpretation would in many cases render ineffective the exchange of information provided for in the Convention. The observations made in paragraph 17 above apply here as well. The requested State in protecting the interests of its taxpayers is given a certain discretion to refuse the requested information, but if it does supply the information deliberately the taxpayer cannot allege an infraction of the rules of secrecy. It is open to the Contracting States to add further dispensations from the obligation to supply information to the items listed in subparagraph <em>c)</em>, for example, information protected by provisions on banker’s discretion. It has been felt necessary also to prescribe a limitation with regard to information which concerns the vital interests of the State itself.

After 28 January 2003 and until 15 July 2005, paragraph 21 read as follows:“21.  Contrary to the interpretation put forward in paragraphs 14 to 16 above, <em>Japan</em> takes the view that the Article imposes no obligation on it to carry out enquiries on behalf of a Contracting State in cases where no liability to its own tax is at issue, since to carry out such enquiries would be contrary to its laws and administrative practice.”</p>
<p id="">Paragraph 21 was amended on 28 January 2003 by the report entitled “The 2002 Update to the Model Tax Convention”, adopted by the OECD Council on 28 January 2003. After 31 March 1994 and until 28 January 2003, paragraph 21 read as follows:“21.  Contrary to the interpretation put forward in paragraphs 14 to 16 above, <em>Japan</em> and the <em>United Kingdom</em> take the view that the Article imposes no obligation on them to carry out enquiries on behalf of a Contracting State in cases where no liability to their own tax is at issue, since to carry out such enquiries would be contrary to their laws and administrative practice.”</p>

After 28 January 2003 and until 15 July 2005, paragraph 22 read as follows:“22.  Contrary to the interpretation put forward in paragraphs 14 to 16 above, the <em>United Kingdom</em> takes the view that the Article as drafted does not impose an obligation on it to invoke statutory information powers on behalf of a Contracting State in cases where no liability to its own tax is at issue, since to invoke such powers in these circumstances is in some cases contrary to its law. In order to foster the effective exchange of information, United Kingdom legislation has therefore been enacted to permit the introduction of such an obligation into the text of the Article by making appropriate modifications.”</p>
<p>Paragraph 22 was added on 28 January 2003 by the report entitled “The 2002 Update to the Model Tax Convention”, adopted by the OECD Council on 28 January 2003.</p>

<p id="">Paragraph 24 was amended on 15 July 2005 by the report entitled “The 2005 Update to the Model Tax Convention”, adopted by the OECD Council on 15 July 2005, on the basis of another report entitled “Changes to Articles 25 and 26 of the Model Tax Convention” (adopted by the OECD Committee on Fiscal Affairs on 1 June 2004).

After 23 July 1992 and until 31 March 1994, paragraph 24 read as follows:“24.  Under the <em>Swiss</em>concept a double taxation convention aims at avoiding international double taxation; the information necessary for the correct application and for the prevention of an abuse of such a convention can be exchanged already within the existing framework of its provisions on the mutual agreement procedure, the reduction of taxes withheld at the source, etc. Switzerland considers a particular provision on the exchange of information as unnecessary since even such an express clause could not, according to the purpose of the Convention, provide for more than for an exchange of information necessary for the correct application and prevention of an abuse of the Convention. Accordingly Switzerland has an express reservation on the Article on the exchange of information.”</p>
<p>Paragraph 24 as it read after 23 July 1992 corresponded to paragraph 23 of the 1977 Model Convention.
