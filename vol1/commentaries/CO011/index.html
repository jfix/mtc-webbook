<p>1.  “Interest” is generally taken to mean remuneration on money lent, being remuneration coming within the category of “income from movable capital” (revenus de capitaux mobiliers). Unlike dividends, interest does not suffer economic double taxation, that is, it is not taxed both in the hands of the debtor and in the hands of the creditor. Unless it is provided to the contrary by the contract, payment of the tax charged on interest falls on the recipient. If it happens that the debtor undertakes to bear any tax chargeable at the source, this is as though he had agreed to pay his creditor additional interest corresponding to such tax.</p>
<p id="CO011-P001"><a href="#CO011-P001-R">(Renumbered and amended on 11 April 1977 see History)</a></p>
<p>2.  But, like dividends, interest on bonds or debentures or loans usually attracts tax charged by deduction at the source when the interest is paid. This method is, in fact, commonly used for practical reasons, as the tax charged at the source can constitute an advance of the tax payable by the recipient in respect of his total income or profits. If in such a case the recipient is a resident of the country which practises deduction at the source, any double taxation he suffers is remedied by internal measures. But the position is different if he is a resident of another country: he is then liable to be taxed twice on the interest, first by the State of source and then by the State of which he is a resident. It is clear that his double charge of tax can reduce considerably the interest on the money lent and so hamper the movement of capital and the development of international investment.</p>

<p>3.  A formula reserving the exclusive taxation of interest to one State, whether the State of the beneficiary’s residence or the State of source, could not be sure of receiving general approval. Therefore a compromise solution was adopted. It provides that interest may be taxed in the State of residence, but leaves to the State of source the right to impose a tax if its laws so provide, it being implicit in this right that the State of source is free to give up all taxation on interest paid to non-residents. Its exercise of this right will however be limited by a ceiling which its tax cannot exceed but, it goes without saying, the Contracting States can agree to adopt an even lower rate of taxation in the State of source. The sacrifice that the latter would accept in such conditions will be matched by a relief to be given by the State of residence, in order to take into account the tax levied in the State of source (see <a href="#A023A">Article 23 A</a> or <a href="#A023B">23 B</a>).</p>

<p>4.  Certain countries do not allow interest paid to be deducted for the purposes of the payer’s tax unless the recipient also resides in the same State or is taxable in that State. Otherwise they forbid the deduction. The question whether the deduction should also be allowed in cases where the interest is paid by a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other State, is dealt with in <a href="#A024-P004">paragraph 4</a> of Article 24.</p>

<p><paragraphsection><title>Paragraph 1</title>5.  Paragraph <a href="#A011-P001">1</a> lays down the principle that interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in the latter. In doing so, it does not stipulate an exclusive right to tax in favour of the State of residence. The term “paid” has a very wide meaning, since the concept of payment means the fulfilment of the obligation to put funds at the disposal of the creditor in the manner required by contract or by custom.</p>
<p id="CO011-P005"><a href="#CO011-P005-R">(Renumbered and amended on 11 April 1977 see History)</a></p>
<p>6.  The Article deals only with interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State. It does not, therefore, apply to interest arising in a third State or to interest arising in a Contracting State which is attributable to a permanent establishment which an enterprise of that State has in the other Contracting State (for these cases, see paragraphs <a href="#CO021-P004">4</a> to <a href="#CO021-P006">6</a> of the Commentary on Article 21).</p>

<p></paragraphsection><paragraphsection><title>Paragraph 2</title>7.  Paragraph <a href="#A011-P002">2</a> reserves a right to tax interest to the State in which the interest arises; but it limits the exercise of that right by determining a ceiling for the tax, which may not exceed 10 per cent. This rate may be considered a reasonable maximum bearing in mind that the State of source is already entitled to tax profits or income produced on its territory by investments financed out of borrowed capital. The Contracting States may agree in bilateral negotiations upon a lower tax or on exclusive taxation in the State of the beneficiary’s residence with respect to all interest payments or, as explained below, as regards some specific categories of interest.</p>
<p id="CO011-P007"><a href="#CO011-P007-R">(Amended on 15 July 2005 see History)</a></p>
<p>7.1  In certain cases, the approach adopted in <a href="#A011-P002">paragraph 2</a>, which is to allow source taxation of payments of interest, can constitute an obstacle to international trade or may be considered inappropriate for other reasons. For instance, when the beneficiary of the interest has borrowed in order to finance the operation which earns the interest, the profit realised by way of interest will be much smaller than the nominal amount of interest received; if the interest paid is equal to or exceeds the interest received, there will be either no profit at all or even a loss. The problem, in that case, cannot be solved by the State of residence, since little or no tax will be levied in that State where the beneficiary is taxed on the net profit derived from the transaction. That problem arises because the tax in the State of source is typically levied on the gross amount of the interest regardless of expenses incurred in order to earn such interest. In order to avoid that problem, creditors will, in practice, tend to shift to the debtor the burden of the tax levied by the State of source on the interest and therefore increase the rate of interest charged to the debtor, whose financial burden is then increased by an amount corresponding to the tax payable to the State of source.</p>

<p>7.2  The Contracting States may wish to add an additional paragraph to provide for the exclusive taxation in the State of the beneficiary’s residence of certain interest. The preamble of that paragraph, which would be followed by subparagraphs describing the various interest subject to that treatment (see below), might be drafted along the following lines:3.  Notwithstanding the provisions of <a href="#A011-P002">paragraph 2</a>, interest referred to in <a href="#A011-P001">paragraph 1</a> shall be taxable only in the Contracting State of which the recipient is a resident if the beneficial owner of the interest is a resident of that State, and:</p>
<ol>
<li>[<em>description of the relevant category of interest</em>] ...</li>
</ol>

<p>7.3  The following are some of the categories of interest that Contracting States may wish to consider for the purposes of <a href="#CO011-P007.02">paragraph 7.2</a> above.</p>
<p id="CO011-P007.03"><a href="#CO011-P007.03-R">(Added on 15 July 2005 see History)</a></p>
<p><title>Interest paid to a State, its political subdivisions and to central banks</title>7.4  Some States refrain from levying tax on income derived by other States and some of their wholly-owned entities (e.g.a central bank established as a separate entity), at least to the extent that such income is derived from activities of a governmental nature. Some States are able to grant such an exemption under their interpretation of the sovereign immunity principle (see paragraphs <a href="#CO001-P006.38">6.38</a> and <a href="#CO001-P006.39">6.39</a> of the Commentary on Article 1); others may do it pursuant to provisions of their domestic law. In their bilateral conventions, many States wish to confirm or clarify the scope of these exemptions with respect to interest or to grant such an exemption in cases where it would not otherwise be available. States wishing to do so may therefore agree to include the following category of interest in a paragraph providing for exemption of certain interest from taxation in the State of source:</p>
<ol>
<li>is that State or the central bank, a political subdivision or local authority thereof;</li>
</ol>
<p id="CO011-P007.04"><a href="#CO011-P007.04-R">(Amended on 22 July 2010 see History)</a></p>
<p><title>Interest paid by a State or its political subdivisions</title>7.5  Where the payer of the interest happens to be the State itself, a political subdivision or a statutory body, the end result may well be that the tax levied at source may actually be borne by that State if the lender increases the interest rate to recoup the tax levied at source. In that case, any benefits for the State taxing the interest at source will be offset by the increase of its borrowing costs. For that reason, many States provide that such interest will be exempt from any tax at source. States wishing to do so may agree to include the following category of interest in a paragraph providing for exemption of certain interest from taxation in the State of source:</p>
<ol>
<li>if the interest is paid by the State in which the interest arises or by a political subdivision, a local authority or statutory body thereof;</li>
</ol>
<p>In this suggested provision, the phrase “statutory body” refers to any public sector institution. Depending on their domestic law and terminology, some States may prefer to use phrases such as “agency or instrumentality” or “legal person of public law” [personne morale de droit public] to refer to such an institution.</p>

<p><title>Interest paid pursuant to export financing programmes</title>7.6  In order to promote international trade, many States have established export financing programmes or agencies which may either provide export loans directly or insure or guarantee export loans granted by commercial lenders. Since that type of financing is supported by public funds, a number of States provide bilaterally that interest arising from loans covered by these programmes shall be exempt from source taxation. States wishing to do so may agree to include the following category of interest in a paragraph providing for exemption of certain interest from taxation in the State of source:</p>
<ol>
<li>if the interest is paid in respect of a loan, debt-claim or credit that is owed to, or made, provided, guaranteed or insured by, that State or a political subdivision, local authority or export financing agency thereof;</li>
</ol>
<p id="CO011-P007.06"><a href="#CO011-P007.06-R">(Added on 15 July 2005 see History)</a></p>
<p><title>Interest paid to financial institutions</title>7.7  The problem described in <a href="#CO011-P007.01">paragraph 7.1</a>, which essentially arises because taxation by the State of source is typically levied on the gross amount of the interest and therefore ignores the real amount of income derived from the transaction for which the interest is paid, is particularly important in the case of financial institutions. For instance, a bank generally finances the loan which it grants with funds lent to it and, in particular, funds accepted on deposit. Since the State of source, in determining the amount of tax payable on the interest, will usually ignore the cost of funds for the bank, the amount of tax may prevent the transaction from occurring unless the amount of that tax is borne by the debtor. For that reason, many States provide that interest paid to a financial institution such as a bank will be exempt from any tax at source. States wishing to do so may agree to include the following in a paragraph providing for exemption of certain interest from taxation in the State of source:</p>
<ol>
<li>is a financial institution;</li>
</ol>

<p><title>Interest on sales on credit</title>7.8  The disadvantages described in <a href="#CO011-P007.01">paragraph 7.1</a> also arise frequently in the case of sales on credit of equipment and other commercial credit sales. The supplier in such cases very often merely passes on to the customer, without any additional charge, the price he will himself have had to pay to a bank or an export finance agency to finance the credit. In these cases, the interest is more an element of the selling price than income from invested capital. In fact, in many cases, the interest incorporated in the amounts of instalments to be paid will be difficult to separate from the actual sale price. States may therefore wish to include interest arising from such sales on credit in a paragraph providing for exemption of certain interest from taxation in the State of source, which they can do by adding the following subparagraph:</p>
<ol>
<li>if the interest is paid with respect to indebtedness arising as a consequence of the sale on credit of any equipment, merchandise or services;</li>
</ol>
<p id="CO011-P007.08"><a href="#CO011-P007.08-R">(Renumbered and amended on 15 July 2005 see History)</a></p>
<p>7.9  The types of sales on credit referred to in this suggested provision comprise not only sales of complete units, but also sales of separate components thereof. Sales financed through a general line of credit provided by a seller to a customer constitute sales on credit as well for the purposes of the provision. Also, it is immaterial whether the interest is stipulated separately in addition to the sale price or is included from the outset in the price payable by instalments.</p>

<p><title>Interest paid to some tax-exempt entities (e.g. pension funds)</title>7.10  Under the domestic laws of many States, pension funds and similar entities are generally exempt from tax on their investment income. In order to achieve neutrality of treatment as regards domestic and foreign investments by these entities, some States provide bilaterally that income, including interest, derived by such an entity resident of the other State shall also be exempt from source taxation. States wishing to do so may agree bilaterally on a provision drafted along the lines of the provision found in <a href="#CO018-P069">paragraph 69</a> of the Commentary on Article 18.</p>
<p id="CO011-P007.10"><a href="#CO011-P007.10-R">(Added on 15 July 2005 see History)</a></p>
<p>7.11  If the Contracting States do not wish to exempt completely any or all of the above categories of interest from taxation in the State of source, they may wish to apply to them a lower rate of tax than that provided for in paragraph 2 (that solution would not, however, seem very practical in the case of interest paid by a State or its political subdivision or statutory body). In that case, paragraph 2 might be drafted along the following lines:2.  However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the interest is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>[lower rate of tax]</em> per cent of the gross amount of the interest in the case of interest paid <em>[description of the relevant category of interest]</em>...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest in all other cases.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of this limitation.If the Contracting States agree to exempt some of the above categories of interest, this alternative provision would be followed by a paragraph 3 as suggested in <a href="#CO011-P007.02">paragraph 7.2</a> above.</p>

<p>8.  Attention is drawn generally to the following case: the beneficial owner of interest arising in a Contracting State is a company resident in the other Contracting State; all or part of its capital is held by shareholders resident outside that other State; its practice is not to distribute its profits in the form of dividends; and it enjoys preferential taxation treatment (private investment company, base company). The question may arise whether, in the case of such a company, it is justifiable to allow in the State of source of the interest the limitation of tax which is provided in <a href="#A011-P002">paragraph 2</a>. It may be appropriate, when bilateral negotiations are being conducted, to agree upon special exceptions to the taxing rule laid down in this Article, in order to define the treatment applicable to such companies.</p>

<p>9.  The requirement of beneficial owner was introduced in <a href="#A011-P002">paragraph 2</a> of Article 11 to clarify the meaning of the words “paid to a resident” as they are used in <a href="#A011-P001">paragraph 1</a> of the Article. It makes plain that the State of source is not obliged to give up taxing rights over interest income merely because that income was paid direct to a resident of a State with which the State of source had concluded a convention.</p>
<p id="CO011-P009"><a href="#CO011-P009-R">(Amended on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>9.1  Since the term “beneficial owner” was added to address potential difficulties arising from the use of the words “paid to a resident” in <a href="#A011-P001">paragraph 1</a>, it was intended to be interpreted in this context and not to refer to any technical meaning that it could have had under the domestic law of a specific country (in fact, when it was added to the paragraph, the term did not have a precise meaning in the law of many countries). The term “beneficial owner” is therefore not used in a narrow technical sense (such as the meaning that it has under the trust law of many common law countries[^51] ), rather, it should be understood in its context, in particular in relation to the words “paid to a resident”, and in light of the object and purposes of the Convention, including avoiding double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion and avoidance.</p>

Relief or exemption in respect of an item of income is granted by the State of source to a resident of the other Contracting State to avoid in whole or in part the double taxation that would otherwise arise from the concurrent taxation of that income by the State of residence. Where an item of income is paid to a resident of a Contracting State acting in the capacity of agent or nominee it would be inconsistent with the object and purpose of the Convention for the State of source to grant relief or exemption merely on account of the status of the direct recipient of the income as a resident of the other Contracting State. The direct recipient of the income in this situation qualifies as a resident but no potential double taxation arises as a consequence of that status since the recipient is not treated as the owner of the income for tax purposes in the State of residence.</p>

<p>10.1  It would be equally inconsistent with the object and purpose of the Convention for the State of source to grant relief or exemption where a resident of a Contracting State, otherwise than through an agency or nominee relationship, simply acts as a conduit for another person who in fact receives the benefit of the income concerned. For these reasons, the report from the Committee on Fiscal Affairs entitled “Double Taxation Conventions and the Use of Conduit Companies”[^52] concludes that a conduit company cannot normally be regarded as the beneficial owner if, though the formal owner, it has, as a practical matter, very narrow powers which render it, in relation to the income concerned, a mere fiduciary or administrator acting on account of the interested parties.</p>
<p id="CO011-P010.01"><a href="#CO011-P010.1-R">(Added on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>10.2  In these various examples (agent, nominee, conduit company acting as a fiduciary or administrator), the direct recipient of the interest is not the “beneficial owner” because that recipient’s right to use and enjoy the interest is constrained by a contractual or legal obligation to pass on the payment received to another person. Such an obligation will normally derive from relevant legal documents but may also be found to exist on the basis of facts and circumstances showing that, in substance, the recipient clearly does not have the right to use and enjoy the interest unconstrained by a contractual or legal obligation to pass on the payment received to another person. This type of obligation would not include contractual or legal obligations that are not dependent on the receipt of the payment by the direct recipient such as an obligation that is not dependent on the receipt of the payment and which the direct recipient has as a debtor or as a party to financial transactions, or typical distribution obligations of pension schemes and of collective investment vehicles entitled to treaty benefits under the principles of paragraphs <a href="#CO001-P006.08">6.8</a> to <a href="#CO001-P006.34">6.34</a> of the Commentary on Article 1. Where the recipient of interest does have the right to use and enjoy the interest unconstrained by a contractual or legal obligation to pass on the payment received to another person, the recipient is the “beneficial owner” of that interest. It should also be noted that <a href="#A011">Article 11</a> refers to the beneficial owner of interest as opposed to the owner of the debt-claim with respect to which the interest is paid, which may be different in some cases.</p>
<p id="CO011-P010.02"><a href="#CO011-P010.02-R">(Added on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>10.3  The fact that the recipient of an interest payment is considered to be the beneficial owner of that interest does not mean, however, that the limitation of tax provided for by <a href="#A011-P002">paragraph 2</a> must automatically be granted. This limitation of tax should not be granted in cases of abuse of this provision (see also <a href="#CO011-P008">paragraph 8</a> above). As explained in the section on “Improper use of the Convention” in the Commentary on Article 1, there are many ways of addressing conduit company and, more generally, treaty shopping situations. These include specific anti-abuse provisions in treaties, general anti-abuse rules and substance-over-form or economic substance approaches. Whilst the concept of “beneficial owner” deals with some forms of tax avoidance (i.e.those involving the interposition of a recipient who is obliged to pass on the interest to someone else), it does not deal with other cases of treaty shopping and must not, therefore, be considered as restricting in any way the application of other approaches to addressing such cases.</p>
<p id="CO011-P010.03"><a href="#CO011-P010.03-R">(Added on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>10.4  The above explanations concerning the meaning of “beneficial owner” make it clear that the meaning given to this term in the context of the Article must be distinguished from the different meaning that has been given to that term in the context of other instruments[^53] that concern the determination of the persons (typically the individuals) that exercise ultimate control over entities or assets. That different meaning of “beneficial owner” cannot be applied in the context of the Convention. Indeed, that meaning, which refers to natural persons (i.e.individuals), cannot be reconciled with the express wording of subparagraph <a href="#A010-P002">2</a> <em>a</em>) of Article 10, which refers to the situation where a company is the beneficial owner of a dividend. In the context of Articles <a href="#A010">10</a> and <a href="#A011">11</a>, the term “beneficial owner” is intended to address difficulties arising from the use of the words “paid to” in relation to dividends and interest rather than difficulties related to the ownership of the shares or debt-claims on which dividends or interest are paid. For that reason, it would be inappropriate, in the context of these Articles, to consider a meaning developed in order to refer to the individuals who exercise “ultimate effective control over a legal person or arrangement”.[^54] </p>

<p>11.  Subject to other conditions imposed by the Article, the limitation of tax in the State of source remains available when an intermediary, such as an agent or nominee located in a Contracting State or in a third State, is interposed between the beneficiary and the payer but the beneficial owner is a resident of the other Contracting State (the text of the Model was amended in 1995 and in 2014 to clarify this point, which has been the consistent position of all member countries).</p>

<p>12.  The paragraph lays down nothing about the mode of taxation in the State of source. It therefore leaves that State free to apply its own laws and, in particular, to levy the tax either by deduction at source or by individual assessment. Procedural questions are not dealt with in this Article. Each State should be able to apply the procedure provided in its own law (see, however, <a href="#CO001-P026.02">paragraph 26.2</a> of the Commentary on Article 1). Specific questions arise with triangular cases (see <a href="#CO024-P071">paragraph 71</a> of the Commentary on Article 24).</p>

<p></paragraphsection><paragraphsection><title>Paragraph 3</title>18.  Paragraph <a href="#A011-P003">3</a> specifies the meaning to be attached to the term “interest” for the application of the taxation treatment defined by the Article. The term designates, in general, income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in profits. The term “debt-claims of every kind” obviously embraces cash deposits and security in the form of money, as well as government securities, and bonds and debentures, although the three latter are specially mentioned because of their importance and of certain peculiarities that they may present. It is recognised, on the one hand, that mortgage interest comes within the category of income from movable capital (revenus de capitaux mobiliers), even though certain countries assimilate it to income from immovable property. On the other hand, debt-claims, and bonds and debentures in particular, which carry a right to participate in the debtor’s profits are nonetheless regarded as loans if the contract by its general character clearly evidences a loan at interest.</p>

<p>19.  Interest on participating bonds should not normally be considered as a dividend, and neither should interest on convertible bonds until such time as the bonds are actually converted into shares. However, the interest on such bonds should be considered as a dividend if the loan effectively shares the risks run by the debtor company (seeinter alia <a href="#CO010-P025">paragraph 25</a> of the Commentary on Article 10). In situations of presumed thin capitalisation, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between dividends and interest and in order to avoid any possibility of overlap between the categories of income dealt with in <a href="#A010">Article 10</a> and <a href="#A011">Article 11</a> respectively, it should be noted that the term “interest” as used in <a href="#A011">Article 11</a> does not include items of income which are dealt with under <a href="#A010">Article 10</a>. </p>
<p id="CO011-P019"><a href="#CO011-P019-R">(Replaced on 23 July 1992 see History)</a></p>
<p>20.  As regards, more particularly, government securities, and bonds and debentures, the text specifies that premiums or prizes attaching thereto constitute interest. Generally speaking, what constitutes interest yielded by a loan security, and may properly be taxed as such in the State of source, is all that the institution issuing the loan pays over and above the amount paid by the subscriber, that is to say, the interest accruing plus any premium paid at redemption or at issue. It follows that when a bond or debenture has been issued at a premium, the excess of the amount paid by the subscriber over that repaid to him may constitute negative interest which should be deducted from the stated interest in determining the interest that is taxable. On the other hand, the definition of interest does not cover any profit or loss that cannot be attributed to a difference between what the issuer received and paid (e.g.a profit or loss, not representing accrued interest or original issue discount or premium, which a holder of a security such as a bond or debenture realises by the sale thereof to another person or by the repayment of the principal of a security that he has acquired from a previous holder for an amount that is different from the amount received by the issuer of the security). Such profit or loss may, depending on the case, constitute either a business profit or a loss, a capital gain or a loss, or income falling under <a href="#A021">Article 21</a>.</p>
<p id="CO011-P020"><a href="#CO011-P020-R">(Amended on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>20.1  The amount that the seller of a bond will receive will typically include the interest that has accrued, but has not yet become payable, at the time of the sale of the bond. In most cases, the State of source will not attempt to tax such accrued interest at the time of the alienation and will only tax the acquirer of the bond or debenture on the full amount of the interest subsequently paid (it is generally assumed that in such a case, the price that the acquirer pays for the bond takes account of the future tax liability of the acquirer on the interest accrued for the benefit of the seller at the time of the alienation). In certain circumstances, however, some States tax the seller of a bond on interest that has accrued at the time of the alienation (e.g.when a bond is sold to a tax-exempt entity). Such accrued interest is covered by the definition of interest and may therefore be taxed by the State of source. In that case, that State should not again tax the same amount in the hands of the acquirer of the bond when the interest subsequently becomes payable.</p>
<p id="CO011-P020.01"><a href="#CO011-P020.01-R">(Added on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>21.  Moreover, the definition of interest in the first sentence of <a href="#A011-P003">paragraph 3</a> is, in principle, exhaustive. It has seemed preferable not to include a subsidiary reference to domestic laws in the text; this is justified by the following considerations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>the definition covers practically all the kinds of income which are regarded as interest in the various domestic laws;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the formula employed offers greater security from the legal point of view and ensures that conventions would be unaffected by future changes in any country’s domestic laws;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in the Model Convention references to domestic laws should as far as possible be avoided.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It nevertheless remains understood that in a bilateral convention two Contracting States may widen the formula employed so as to include in it any income which is taxed as interest under either of their domestic laws but which is not covered by the definition and in these circumstances may find it preferable to make reference to their domestic laws.</p>
<p><a href="#CO011-P021-R">(Renumbered on 23 July 1992 see History)</a>21.1  The definition of interest in the first sentence of <a href="#A011-P003">paragraph 3</a> does not normally apply to payments made under certain kinds of nontraditional financial instruments where there is no underlying debt (for example, interest rate swaps). However, the definition will apply to the extent that a loan is considered to exist under a “substance over form” rule, an “abuse of rights” principle, or any similar doctrine.</p>

<p>22.  The second sentence of <a href="#A011-P003">paragraph 3</a> excludes from the definition of interest penalty charges for late payment but Contracting States are free to omit this sentence and treat penalty charges as interest in their bilateral conventions. Penalty charges, which may be payable under the contract, or by customs or by virtue of a judgement, consist either of payments calculatedpro rata temporisor else of fixed sums; in certain cases they may combine both forms of payment. Even if they are determinedpro rata temporisthey constitute not so much income from capital as a special form of compensation for the loss suffered by the creditor through the debtor’s delay in meeting his obligations. Moreover, considerations of legal security and practical convenience make it advisable to place all penalty charges of this kind, in whatever form they be paid, on the same footing for the purposes of their taxation treatment. On the other hand, two Contracting States may exclude from the application of <a href="#A011">Article 11</a>any kinds of interest which they intend to be treated as dividends.</p>

<p>23.  Finally, the question arises whether annuities ought to be assimilated to interest; it is considered that they ought not to be. On the one hand, annuities granted in consideration of past employment are referred to in <a href="#A018">Article 18</a> and are subject to the rules governing pensions. On the other hand, although it is true that instalments of purchased annuities include an interest element on the purchase capital as well as return of capital, such instalments thus constituting “fruits civils” which accrue from day to day, it would be difficult for many countries to make a distinction between the element representing income from capital and the element representing a return of capital in order merely to tax the income element under the same category as income from movable capital. Taxation laws often contain special provisions classifying annuities in the category of salaries, wages and pensions, and taxing them accordingly.</p>

<p></paragraphsection><paragraphsection><title>Paragraph 4</title>24.  Certain States consider that dividends, interest and royalties arising from sources in their territory and payable to individuals or legal persons who are residents of other States fall outside the scope of the arrangement made to prevent them from being taxed both in the State of source and in the State of the beneficiary’s residence when the beneficiary has a permanent establishment in the former State. <a href="#A011-P004">Paragraph 4</a> is not based on such a conception which is sometimes referred to as “the force of attraction of the permanent establishment”. It does not stipulate that interest arising to a resident of a Contracting State from a source situated in the other State must, by a kind of legal presumption, or fiction even, be related to a permanent establishment which that resident may have in the latter State, so that the said State would not be obliged to limit its taxation in such a case. The paragraph merely provides that in the State of source the interest is taxable as part of the profits of the permanent establishment there owned by the beneficiary which is a resident in the other State, if it is paid in respect of debt-claims forming part of the assets of the permanent establishment or otherwise effectively connected with that establishment. In that case, <a href="#A011-P004">paragraph 4</a> relieves the State of source of the interest from any limitation under the Article. The foregoing explanations accord with those in the <a href="#CO007">Commentary on Article 7</a>.</p>
<p id="CO011-P024"><a href="#CO011-P024-R">(Renumbered on 23 July 1992 see History)</a></p>
<p>25.  It has been suggested that the paragraph could give rise to abuses through the transfer of loans to permanent establishments set up solely for that purpose in countries that offer preferential treatment to interest income. Apart from the fact that such abusive transactions might trigger the application of domestic anti-abuse rules, it must be recognised that a particular location can only constitute a permanent establishment if a business is carried on therein and, as explained below, that the requirement that a debt-claim be “effectively connected” to such a location requires more than merely recording the debt-claim in the books of the permanent establishment for accounting purposes.</p>
<p id="CO011-P025"><a href="#CO011-P025-R">(Amended on 22 July 2010 see History)</a></p>
<p>25.1  A debt-claim in respect of which interest is paid will be effectively connected with a permanent establishment, and will therefore form part of its business assets, if the “economic” ownership of the debt-claim is allocated to that permanent establishment under the principles developed in the Committee’s report entitled *Attribution of Profits to Permanent Establishments[^55] * (see in particular paragraphs 72 to 97 of Part I of the report) for the purposes of the application of <a href="#A007-P002">paragraph 2</a> of Article 7. In the context of that paragraph, the “economic” ownership of a debt-claim means the equivalent of ownership for income tax purposes by a separate enterprise, with the attendant benefits and burdens (e.g.the right to the interest attributable to the ownership of the debt-claim and the potential exposure to gains or losses from the appreciation or depreciation of the debt-claim).</p>
<p id="CO011-P025.01"><a href="#CO011-P025.01-R">(Added on 22 July 2010 see History)</a></p>
<p>25.2  In the case of the permanent establishment of an enterprise carrying on insurance activities, the determination of whether a debt-claim is effectively connected with the permanent establishment shall be made by giving due regard to the guidance set forth in Part IV of the Committee’s report with respect to whether the income on or gain from that debt-claim is taken into account in determining the permanent establishment’s yield on the amount of investment assets attributed to it (see in particular paragraphs 165 to 170 of Part IV). That guidance being general in nature, tax authorities should consider applying a flexible and pragmatic approach which would take into account an enterprise’s reasonable and consistent application of that guidance for purposes of identifying the specific assets that are effectively connected with the permanent establishment.</p>

<p></paragraphsection><paragraphsection><title>Paragraph 5</title>26.  This paragraph lays down the principle that the State of source of the interest is the State of which the payer of the interest is a resident. It provides, however, for an exception to this rule in the case of interest-bearing loans which have an obvious economic link with a permanent establishment owned in the other Contracting State by the payer of the interest. If the loan was contracted for the requirements of that establishment and the interest is borne by the latter, the paragraph determines that the source of the interest is in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated, leaving aside the place of residence of the owner of the permanent establishment, even when he resides in a third State.</p>
<p id="CO011-P026"><a href="#CO011-P026-R">(Amended on 21 September 1995 see History)</a></p>
<p>27.  In the absence of an economic link between the loan on which the interest arises and the permanent establishment, the State where the latter is situated cannot on that account be regarded as the State where the interest arises; it is not entitled to tax such interest, not even within the limits of a “taxable quota” proportional to the importance of the permanent establishment. Such a practice would be incompatible with <a href="#A011-P005">paragraph 5</a>. Moreover, any departure from the rule fixed in the first sentence of <a href="#A011-P005">paragraph 5</a> is justified only where the economic link between the loan and the permanent establishment is sufficiently clear-cut. In this connection, a number of possible cases may be distinguished:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The management of the permanent establishment has contracted a loan which it uses for the specific requirements of the permanent establishment; it shows it among its liabilities and pays the interest thereon directly to the creditor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The head office of the enterprise has contracted a loan the proceeds of which are used solely for the purposes of a permanent establishment situated in another country. The interest is serviced by the head office but is ultimately borne by the permanent establishment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The loan is contracted by the head office of the enterprise and its proceeds are used for several permanent establishments situated in different countries.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In cases <em>a)</em> and <em>b)</em> the conditions laid down in the second sentence of <a href="#A011-P005">paragraph 5</a> are fulfilled, and the State where the permanent establishment is situated is to be regarded as the State where the interest arises. Case <em>c)</em>, however, falls outside the provisions of <a href="#A011-P005">paragraph 5</a>, the text of which precludes the attribution of more than one source to the same loan. Such a solution, moreover, would give rise to considerable administrative complications and make it impossible for lenders to calculate in advance the taxation that interest would attract. It is, however, open to two Contracting States to restrict the application of the final provision in <a href="#A011-P005">paragraph 5</a> to case <em>a)</em> or to extend it to case <em>c)</em>.</p>
<p><a href="#CO011-P027-R">(Renumbered on 23 July 1992 see History)</a>28.  Paragraph <a href="#A011-P005">5</a> provides no solution for the case, which it excludes from its provisions, where both the beneficiary and the payer are indeed residents of the Contracting States, but the loan was borrowed for the requirements of a permanent establishment owned by the payer in a third State and the interest is borne by that establishment. As <a href="#A011-P005">paragraph 5</a> now stands, therefore, only its first sentence will apply in such a case. The interest will be deemed to arise in the Contracting State of which the payer is a resident and not in the third State in whose territory is situated the permanent establishment for the account of which the loan was effected and by which the interest is payable. Thus the interest will be taxed both in the Contracting State of which the payer is a resident and in the Contracting State of which the beneficiary is a resident. But, although double taxation will be avoided between these two States by the arrangements provided in the Article, it will not be avoided between them and the third State if the latter taxes the interest on the loan at the source when it is borne by the permanent establishment in its territory.</p>
<p id="CO011-P028"><a href="#CO011-P028-R">(Renumbered on 23 July 1992 see History)</a></p>
<p>29.  It has been decided not to deal with that case in the Convention. The Contracting State of the payer’s residence does not, therefore, have to relinquish its tax at the source in favour of the third State in which is situated the permanent establishment for the account of which the loan was effected and by which the interest is borne. If this were not the case and the third State did not subject the interest borne by the permanent establishment to source taxation, there could be attempts to avoid source taxation in the Contracting State through the use of a permanent establishment situated in such a third State. States for which this is not a concern and that wish to address the issue described in the paragraph above may do so by agreeing to use, in their bilateral convention, the alternative formulation of paragraph 5 suggested in <a href="#CO011-P030">paragraph 30</a>below. The risk of double taxation just referred to could also be avoided through a multilateral convention. Also, if in the case described in <a href="#CO011-P028">paragraph 28</a>, the State of the payer’s residence and the third State in which is situated the permanent establishment for the account of which the loan is effected and by which the interest is borne, together claim the right to tax the interest at the source, there would be nothing to prevent those two States together with, where appropriate, the State of the beneficiary’s residence, from concerting measures to avoid the double taxation that would result from such claims using, where necessary, the mutual agreement procedure (as envisaged in <a href="#A025-P003">paragraph 3</a> of Article 25).</p>
<p id="CO011-P029"><a href="#CO011-P029-R">(Amended on 15 July 2005 see History)</a></p>
<p id="">30.  As mentioned in <a href="#CO011-P029">paragraph 29</a>, any such double taxation could be avoided either through a multilateral convention or if the State of the beneficiary’s residence and the State of the payer’s residence agreed to word the second sentence of <a href="#A011-P005">paragraph 5</a> in the following way, which would have the effect of ensuring that paragraphs <a href="#A011-P001">1</a> and <a href="#A011-P002">2</a>of the Article did not apply to the interest, which would then typically fall under <a href="#A007">Article 7</a> or <a href="#A021">21</a>:Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a State other than that of which he is a resident a permanent establishment in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by such permanent establishment, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated.</p>
<p id="CO011-P030"><a href="#CO011-P030-R">(Amended on 15 July 2005 see History)</a></p>
<p>31.  If two Contracting States agree in bilateral negotiations to reserve to the State where the beneficiary of the income resides the exclusive right to tax such income, thenipso factothere is no value in inserting in the convention which fixes their relations that provision in <a href="#A011-P005">paragraph 5</a> which defines the State of source of such income. But it is equally obvious that double taxation would not be fully avoided in such a case if the payer of the interest owned, in a third State which charged its tax at the source on the interest, a permanent establishment for the account of which the loan had been borrowed and which bore the interest payable on it. The case would then be just the same as is contemplated in paragraphs <a href="#CO011-P028">28</a> to <a href="#CO011-P030">30</a> above.</p>

The purpose of this paragraph is to restrict the operation of the provisions concerning the taxation of interest in cases where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest paid exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner had they stipulated at arm’s length. It provides that in such a case the provisions of the Article apply only to that last-mentioned amount and that the excess part of the interest shall remain taxable according to the laws of the two Contracting States, due regard being had to the other provisions of the Convention.</p>

It is clear from the text that for this clause to apply the interest held excessive must be due to a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person. There may be cited as examples cases where interest is paid to an individual or legal person who directly or indirectly controls the payer, or who is directly or indirectly controlled by him or is subordinate to a group having common interest with him. These examples, moreover, are similar or analogous to the cases contemplated by <a href="#A009">Article 9</a>.</p>
<p id="CO011-P033"><a href="#CO011-P033-R">(Renumbered and amended on 23 July 1992 see History)</a></p>
<p>34.  On the other hand, the concept of special relationship also covers relationship by blood or marriage and, in general, any community of interests as distinct from the legal relationship giving rise to the payment of the interest.</p>

<p>35.  With regard to the taxation treatment to be applied to the excess part of the interest, the exact nature of such excess will need to be ascertained according to the circumstances of each case, in order to determine the category of income in which it should be classified for the purposes of applying the provisions of the tax laws of the States concerned and the provisions of the Convention. This paragraph permits only the adjustment of the rate at which interest is charged and not the reclassification of the loan in such a way as to give it the character of a contribution to equity capital. For such an adjustment to be possible under <a href="#A011-P006">paragraph 6</a> of Article 11 it would be necessary as a minimum to remove the limiting phrase “having regard to the debt-claim for which it is paid”. If greater clarity of intent is felt appropriate, a phrase such as “for whatever reason” might be added after “exceeds”. Either of these alternative versions would apply where some or all of an interest payment is excessive because the amount of the loan or the terms relating to it (including the rate of interest) are not what would have been agreed upon in the absence of the special relationship. Nevertheless, this paragraph can affect not only the recipient but also the payer of excessive interest and if the law of the State of source permits, the excess amount can be disallowed as a deduction, due regard being had to other applicable provisions of the Convention. If two Contracting States should have difficulty in determining the other provisions of the Convention applicable, as cases require, to the excess part of the interest, there would be nothing to prevent them from introducing additional clarifications in the last sentence of <a href="#A011-P006">paragraph 6</a>, as long as they do not alter its general purport.</p>

<p>36.  Should the principles and rules of their respective laws oblige the two Contracting States to apply different Articles of the Convention for the purpose of taxing the excess, it will be necessary to resort to the mutual agreement procedure provided by the Convention in order to resolve the difficulty.</p>

<p id=""><strong><a href="#CO011-P001">Paragraph 1</a></strong>: Corresponds in part to paragraphs 1 and 2 of the 1963 Draft Convention. Paragraphs 1 and 2 were combined and amended when the 1977 Model Convention was adopted by the OECD Council on 11 April 1977. At the same time, the headings immediately preceding paragraphs 1 and 2 were deleted. In the 1963 Draft Convention (adopted by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963) and until the adoption of the 1977 Model Convention, paragraphs 1 and 2 and the preceding headings read as follows:“A.    Definition of Interest for the Purposes of this Report</p>
<p>1.  “Interest” is generally taken to mean remuneration on money lent, being remuneration coming within the category of “income from movable capital” (revenus de capitaux mobiliers). Such remuneration includes, in particular, interest on and all other income — to which certain taxation laws assimilate prizes and redemption premiums — from:<itemizedlist></p>

<p id="">B. International Double Taxation of Interest</p>
<p id="">2.  Unlike dividends, interest does not suffer economic double taxation, that is, it is not taxed both in the hands of the debtor and in the hands of the creditor. Unless it is provided to the contrary by the contract, payment of the tax charged on interest falls on the recipient. If it happens that the debtor undertakes to bear any tax chargeable at the source, this is as though he had agreed to pay his creditor additional interest corresponding to such tax. Subject to the remarks made later (paragraph 17), the debtor may nevertheless show the interest paid and any tax so borne in his enterprise’s general expense.”</p>
<p id=""><strong><a href="#CO011-P002">Paragraph 2</a></strong>: Corresponds to paragraph 3 of the 1963 Draft Convention. Paragraph 2 of the 1963 Draft Convention was amended and incorporated into paragraph 1 (see history of paragraph 1) when the 1977 Model Convention was adopted by the OECD Council on 11 April 1977. At the same time, paragraph 3 of the 1963 Draft Convention was amended and renumbered as paragraph 2 of the 1977 Model Convention. In the 1963 Draft Convention (adopted by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963) and until the adoption of the 1977 Model Convention, paragraph 3 read as follows:“3.  But, like dividends, interest on bonds or debentures or loans usually attracts tax charged by deduction at the source when the interest is paid. This method is, in fact, commonly used for practical reasons, as the tax charged at the source can constitute an advance of the tax payable by the recipient in respect of his total income or profits. If in such a case the recipient is a resident of the country which practices deduction at the source, any double taxation he suffers is remedied by internal measures. But the position is different if he is a resident of another country: he is then liable to be taxed twice on the interest, first by the State of source and then by the State in which he resides. It is clear that his double charge of tax can reduce considerably the interest on the money lent and so hamper the movement of capital and the development of international investment.”</p>
<p id=""><strong><a href="#CO011-P003">Paragraph 3</a></strong>: Corresponds in part to paragraphs 14 and 15 of the 1963 Draft Convention. Paragraph 3 of the 1963 Draft Convention was amended and renumbered as paragraph 2 (see history of paragraph 2) when the 1977 Model Convention was adopted by the OECD Council on 11 April 1977. At the same time, paragraphs 14 and 15 of the 1963 Draft Convention were amended and incorporated into paragraph 3 of the 1977 Model Convention. In the 1963 Draft Convention (adopted by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963) and until the adoption of the 1977 Model Convention, paragraphs 14 and 15 read as follows:“14.  The discussions further showed that a formula reserving the exclusive taxation of interest to one State, whether the State of the recipient’s residence or the State of source, could not be sure of receiving general approval. Some countries stated that their preference was for taxation in the State of residence, others for taxation in the State of source. A number of countries which practise taxation at the source considered that they would be able to give up the right to tax at the source if certain conditions were concurrently present; but they at once made it clear that they could not be bound by a text which left them no discretion in this respect.</p>
<p id="">15.  The Fiscal Committee therefore has been obliged to turn towards a compromise solution, first laying down the principle that interest shall be taxed in the State of residence — particularly as this is the practice in the generality of the Member states — but leaving the State of source the right to impose a tax if its laws so provide, it being implicit in this right that the State of source is free to give up all taxation on interest paid to non-residents. Its exercise of this right will however be limited by a ceiling which its tax cannot exceed but, it goes without saying, the Contracting States can agree to adopt an even lower rate of taxation in the State of source. The sacrifice that the latter would accept in such conditions will be matched by a similar sacrifice for the State of residence, since it will have to take into account the tax levied in the State of source in order to prevent the double taxation that the interest would suffer if the State of residence imposed on itself no restriction in the exercise of its right (on this subject see Articles 23(A) and 23(B) on methods of avoiding double taxation in the State of residence of the recipient of the income).”</p>
<p id=""><strong><a href="#CO011-P004">Paragraph 4</a></strong>: Amended on 23 July 1992, by replacing the reference to paragraph 5 of Article 24 with a reference to paragraph 4 of that Article, by the Report entitled “The Revision of the Model Convention”, adopted by the OECD Council on 23 July 1992. In the 1977 Model Convention and until 23 July 1992, paragraph 4 read as follows:“4.  Certain countries do not allow interest paid to be deducted for the purposes of the payer’s tax unless the recipient also resides in the same State or is taxable in that State. Otherwise they forbid the deduction. The question whether the deduction should also be allowed in cases where the interest is paid by a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other State, is dealt with in paragraph 5 of Article 24.”</p>
<p id="">Paragraph 4 of the 1977 Model Convention corresponded to paragraph 17 of the 1963 Draft Convention. Paragraph 4 of the 1963 Draft Convention was deleted and paragraph 17 was amended and renumbered when the 1977 Model Convention was adopted by the OECD Council on 11 April 1977. In the 1963 Draft Convention (adopted by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963) and until the adoption of the 1977 Model Convention, paragraph 17 read as follows:“17.  Certain countries do not allow interest paid to be deducted for the purposes of the payer’s tax unless the recipient also resides in the same State or is taxable in that State. Otherwise they forbid the deduction. The Fiscal Committee considers it desirable that the deduction in question should also be allowed in cases where the interest is paid by a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other State, the case of fraud being, of course, reserved; it considers that the deduction should not be forbidden simply because the tax payable by the recipient of such interest is reduced in the State of source in application of the proposed Article. Any other method of procedure might cancel out the beneficial effects of the measures taken to avoid double taxation.”</p>
<p id="">Paragraph 4 of the 1963 Draft Convention and the preceding heading were deleted when the 1977 Model Convention was adopted by the OECD Council on 11 April 1977. In the 1963 Draft Convention (adopted by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963) and until the adoption of the 1977 Model Convention, paragraph 4 and the preceding heading read as follows:“C. How Can Double Taxation of Interest be Avoided?</p>
<p id="">4.  There is no point in re-opening doctrinal arguments on the respective merits of taxing interest in the State of source or in the State of the recipient’s residence, according to whether the tax is impersonal or personal; or in considering whether the theoretically ideal solution would not be for the right to tax to be the privilege of the State of the creditor’s residence, on the principle that movable property is intimately associated with the person of its owner and that tax on the income that is produces should properly be borne by the owner. Very detailed studies were made on this subject in the League of Nations. These resulted in the elaboration of different, not to say conflicting, proposals as to the taxation of interest.”</p>
<p id=""><strong><a href="#CO011-P005">Paragraph 5</a></strong>: Corresponds to paragraph 18 of the 1963 Draft Convention. Paragraph 5 of the 1963 Draft Convention was deleted and paragraph 18 was amended and renumbered as paragraph 5 when the 1977 Model Convention was adopted by the OECD Council on 11 April 1977. At the same time, the headings preceding paragraph 18 were amended and moved with it. In the 1963 Draft Convention (adopted by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963) and until the adoption of the 1977 Model Convention, paragraph 18 and the preceding headings read as follows:“II. COMMENTARY ON THE ARTICLE</p>
<p id=""><em>Paragraph 1</em></p>
<p id="">18.  This paragraph lays down the principle that interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in the latter. In doing so, it does not stipulate an exclusive right to tax in favour of the State of residence, but simply repeats the rule deriving from the generality of tax laws which include the right to tax income of this kind in the State of the recipient’s residence.”</p>
<p id="">Paragraph 5 of the 1963 Draft Convention was deleted when the 1977 Model Convention was adopted by the OECD Council on 11 April 1977. In the 1963 Draft Convention (adopted by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963) and until the adoption of the 1977 Model Convention, paragraph 5 read as follows:“5.  The fact is that countries which export capital and countries in which it is invested have apparently opposed interests. The former are naturally inclined to advocate that income from exported capital should be taxed in the State of the recipient’s residence, and the latter in the State of source of the income.”</p>
<p id=""><strong><a href="#CO011-P006">Paragraph 6</a></strong>: Replaced when the 1977 Model Convention was adopted by the OECD Council on 11 April 1977. At that time, paragraph 6 of the 1963 Draft Convention was deleted and a new paragraph 6 was added. In the 1963 Draft Convention (adopted by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963) and until the adoption of the 1977 Model Convention, paragraph 6 read as follows:“6.  Although the State in which the capital is invested may be entitled to tax income paid as interest on capital coming from another State, on the ground that the income results from the use of such capital and has its source in its territory, it would be exorbitant for it to claim that it alone had the right to tax it. The State exporting the capital can no less justifiably maintain that if the payment of the interest on the capital is made possible by the use of the capital, it is also, and primarily, due to the very existence of the capital, so that it too is justified in calling upon the owners of the capital — the recipients of the interest — to participate in the public expenses, by reason of their possession of such income.”</p>
<p id=""><strong><a href="#CO011-P007">Paragraph 7</a></strong>: Amended on 15 July 2005 by the report entitled “The 2005 Update to the Model Tax Convention”, adopted by the OECD Council on 15 July 2005. In the 1977 Model Convention and until 15 July 2005, paragraph 7 read as follows:“7.  Paragraph 2 reserves a right to tax interest to the State in which the interest arises; but it limits the exercise of that right by determining a ceiling for the tax, which may not exceed 10 per cent. This rate may be considered a reasonable maximum bearing in mind that the State of source is already entitled to tax profits or income produced on its territory by investments financed out of borrowed capital. The Contracting States may agree in bilateral negotiations upon a lower tax or even on exclusive taxation in the State of the beneficiary’s residence.”</p>
<p id="">Paragraph 7 of the 1977 Model Convention corresponded to 19 of the 1963 Draft Convention. Paragraph 7 of the 1963 Draft Convention was deleted and paragraph 19 was amended and renumbered as paragraph 7 when the 1977 Model Convention was adopted by the OECD Council on 11 April 1977. At the same time, heading the preceding paragraph 18 was moved with it. In the 1963 Draft Convention (adopted by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963) and until the adoption of the 1977 Model Convention, paragraph 19 read as follows:“19.  Paragraph 2 reserves a right to tax interest to the State in which the interest arises; but it limits the exercise of that right by determining a ceiling for the tax, which may not exceed 10 per cent. This rate may be considered a reasonable maximum if it is remembered that the State of source is already entitled to tax profits or income produced on its territory by investments financed out of borrowed capital. The two Contracting States may agree through bilateral negotiations upon a lower tax or even on exclusive taxation in the State of the recipient’s residence (see on this point the reservation entered by Italy which is recorded in Section III).”</p>
<p id="">Paragraph 7 of the 1963 Draft Convention was deleted when the 1977 Model Convention was adopted by the OECD Council on 11 April 1977. In the 1963 Draft Convention (adopted by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963) and until the adoption of the 1977 Model Convention, paragraph 4 read as follows:“7.  Thus it is clear that both solutions — that which would give an exclusive right to tax to the country of source of the interest and that which would reserve it to the country of the creditor’s residence — are too rigid.”</p>

After 15 July 2005 and until 15 July 2014, paragraph 7.7 read as follows:“7.7  The problem described in paragraph 7.1, which essentially arises because taxation by the State of source is typically levied on the gross amount of the interest and therefore ignores the real amount of income derived from the transaction for which the interest is paid, is particularly important in the case of financial institutions. For instance, a bank generally finances the loan which it grants with funds lent to it and, in particular, funds accepted on deposit. Since the State of source, in determining the amount of tax payable on the interest, will usually ignore the cost of funds for the bank, the amount of tax may prevent the transaction from occurring unless the amount of that tax is borne by the debtor. For that reason, many States provide that interest paid to a financial institution such as a bank will be exempt from any tax at source. States wishing to do so may agree to include the following interest in a paragraph providing from exemption of certain interest from taxation in the State of source:</p>

The disadvantages just mentioned arise in business, particularly with the sale on credit of equipment, other commercial credit sales, and loans granted by banks. The supplier in such cases very often merely passes on to the customer, without any additional charge, the price he will himself have had to pay to a bank or an export finance agency to finance the credit; similarly, the banker generally finances the loan which he grants with funds lent to his bank and, in particular, funds accepted by him on deposit.

The question may arise whether, in the case of such a company, it is justifiable to allow in the State of source the restriction of tax which is provided in paragraph 2 of the Article.

After 15 July 2005 and until 15 July 2014, paragraph 10 and its footnote read as follows:“10.  Relief or exemption in respect of an item of income is granted by the State of source to a resident of the other Contracting State to avoid in whole or in part the double taxation that would otherwise arise from the concurrent taxation of that income by the State of residence. Where an item of income is received by a resident of a Contracting State acting in the capacity of agent or nominee it would be inconsistent with the object and purpose of the Convention for the State of source to grant relief or exemption merely on account of the status of the immediate recipient of the income as a resident of the other Contracting State. The immediate recipient of the income in this situation qualifies as a resident but no potential double taxation arises as a consequence of that status since the recipient is not treated as the owner of the income for tax purposes in the State of residence. It would be equally inconsistent with the object and purpose of the Convention for the State of source to grant relief or exemption where a resident of a Contracting State, otherwise than through an agency or nominee relationship, simply acts as a conduit for another person who in fact receives the benefit of the income concerned. For these reasons, the report from the Committee on Fiscal Affairs entitled “Double Taxation Conventions and the Use of Conduit Companies”<a href="#CO011-P010vnote">1</a> concludes that a conduit company cannot normally be regarded as the beneficial owner if, though the formal owner, it has, as a practical matter, very narrow powers which render it, in relation to the income concerned, a mere fiduciary or administrator acting on account of the interested parties.</p>

It should, however, be pointed out that the solution adopted, given the combined effect of the right to tax accorded to the State of source and the allowance to be made for the tax levied there against that due in the State of residence, could, in certain cases, result in maintaining partial double taxation and lead to adverse economic consequences. In fact, when the beneficiary of the interest has himself had to borrow in order to finance the operation which earns him interest, the profit he will realise by way of interest will be much smaller than the nominal amount of interest he receives; if the interest he pays and that which he receives balance, there will be no profit at all. In such a case, the allowance to be made under paragraph 2 of Article 23 A, or paragraph 1 of Article 23 B, raises a difficult and sometimes insoluble problem in view of the fact that the tax levied in the State where the interest arises is calculated on the gross amount thereof, whereas the same interest is reflected in the beneficiary’s business results at its net amount only. The result of this is that part, or sometimes even the whole amount, of the tax levied in the State where the interest arises cannot be allowed as a credit in the beneficiary’s State of residence and so constitutes an excess charge for the beneficiary, who, to that extent, suffers double taxation. Moreover, the latter, in order to avoid the disadvantage just mentioned, will tend to increase the rate of interest he charges his debtor, whose financial burden would then be increased to a corresponding extent. Thus in certain cases the practice of taxation at the source can constitute an obstacle to international trade. Furthermore, if the payer of the interest happens to be the State itself, a public sector institution, or an enterprise guaranteed by the State, the end result may well be that the tax levied at source is actually borne by the Treasury of the debtor’s State, which latter thus derives no real benefit from its own taxation.”</p>

In the 1977 Model Convention and until 23 July 1992, paragraph 18 read as follows:“18.  Paragraph 3 specifies the meaning to be attached to the term “interest” for the application of the taxation treatment defined by the Article. The term designates, in general, income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in profits. The term “debt-claims of every kind” obviously embraces cash deposits and security in the form of money, as well as Government securities, and bonds and debentures, although the three latter are specially mentioned because of their importance and of certain peculiarities that they may present. It is recognised, on the one hand, that mortgage interest comes within the category of income from movable capital (“revenus de capitaux mobiliers”), even though certain countries assimilate it to income from immovable property. On the other hand, debt-claims, and bonds and debentures in particular, which carry a right to participate in the debtor’s profits are nonetheless regarded as loans if the contract by its general character clearly evidences a loan at interest. In the contrary case, where the participation in profits rests upon a provision of funds that is subject to the hazards of the enterprise’s business, the operation is not in the nature of a loan and Article 11 does not apply. As regards, more particularly, Government securities, and bonds and debentures, the text specifies that premiums or prizes attaching thereto constitute interest. Generally speaking, what constitutes interest yielded by a loan security, and may properly be taxed as such in the State of source, is all that the institution issuing the loan pays over and above the amount paid by the subscriber, that is to say, the interest accruing plus any premium paid at redemption or at issue. It follows that when a bond or debenture has been issued at a premium, the excess of the amount paid by the subscriber over that repaid to him may constitute negative interest which should be deducted from the interest that is taxable. On the other hand, any profit or loss which a holder of such a security realises by the sale thereof to another person does not enter into the concept of interest. Such profit or loss may, depending on the case, constitute either a business profit or a loss, a capital gain or a loss, or income falling under Article 21.”</p>

This paragraph specifies the meaning to be attached to the term “interest” for the application of the taxation treatment defined by the Article. In particular, the term designates income from bonds or debentures, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a fight to participate in profits, and debt claims of all kinds, including mortgages. Bonds or debentures which participate in profits are nonetheless regarded as loan securities if the contract of issue by its general character constitutes evidence of a loan at interest. It is also recognised that mortgage interest comes within the category of income from movable capital (“revenus de capitaux mobiliers”), although certain countries assimilate it to income from immovable capital.”</p>

Finally, the question arose whether annuities ought to be assimilated to interest; it was decided that they ought not to be. On the one hand, annuities granted in consideration of past employment are referred to in Article 18 and are subject to the rules governing pensions. On the other hand, although it is true that installments of purchased annuities include an interest element on the purchase capital as well as return of capital, such installments thus constituting “fruits civils” which accrue from day to day, it would be difficult for many countries to make a distinction between the element representing income from capital and the element representing a return of capital in order merely to tax the income element under the same category as income from movable capital. Taxation laws often contain special provisions classifying annuities in the category of salaries, wages and pensions, and taxing them accordingly.”</p>

Paragraph 4 of the Article is not based on such a conception which is sometimes referred to as “the force of attraction of the permanent establishment”. It does not stipulate that interest arising to a resident of a Contracting State from a source situated in the territory of the other State must, by a kind of legal presumption, or fiction even, be related to a permanent establishment which that resident may happen to possess in the latter State, so that the said State would not be obliged to limit its taxation in such a case. The paragraph merely provides that in the State of source the interest is taxable as part of the profits of the permanent establishment there owned by the recipient residing in the other State, if it is paid in respect of debt claims forming part of the assets of the permanent establishment or otherwise effectively connected with that establishment. In that case, paragraph 4 relieves the State of source of the interest from any limitation under the Article. The foregoing explanations accord with those in the Commentaries on Article 7 on the taxation of business profits.”</p>

It has been suggested that the paragraph could give rise to abuses through the transfer of loans to permanent establishments set up solely for that purpose in countries that offer preferential treatment to interest income. Apart from the fact that such abusive transactions might trigger the application of domestic anti-abuse rules, it must be recognised that a particular location can only constitute a permanent establishment if a business is carried on therein and, also, that the requirement that a debt-claim be “effectively connected” to such a location requires that the debt-claim be genuinely connected to that business.”</p>

The interest will be deemed to arise in the Contracting State where the payer resides, and not in the third State in whose territory is situated the permanent establishment for the account of which the loan was effected and by which the interest is payable. Thus the interest will be taxed both in the Contracting State where the payer resides and in the Contracting State where the recipient resides.

At the same time, paragraph 32 of the 1963 Draft Convention was amended and renumbered as paragraph 29 of the 1977 Model Convention. In the 1963 Draft Convention (adopted by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963) and until the adoption of the 1977 Model Convention, paragraph 32 read as follows:“32.  It goes without saying that if two Contracting States agree in bilateral negotiations to reserve to the State where the recipient of the income resides the exclusive right to tax such income, then ipso facto there is no value in inserting in the Convention which fixes their relations that provision in paragraph 5 of the Article which defines the State of source of such income. But it is equally obvious that double taxation would not be fully avoided in such a case if the payer of the interest owned, in a third State which charged its tax at the source on the interest, a permanent establishment for the account of which the loan had been borrowed and which bore the interest payable on them. The case would then be just the same as is contemplated in paragraphs 29 to 31 above.”</p>

This paragraph permits only the adjustment of the rate at which interest is charged and not the reclassification of the loan in such a way as to give it the character of a contribution to equity capital. For such an adjustment to be possible under paragraph 6 of Article 11 it would be necessary to substitute other words for the phrase “having regard to the debt-claim for which it is paid”. Nevertheless, this paragraph can affect not only the recipient but also the payer of excessive interest and if the law of the State of source permits, the excess amount can be disallowed as a deduction, due regard being had to other applicable provisions of the Convention. If two Contracting States should have difficulty in determining the other provisions of the Convention applicable, as cases require, to the excess part of the interest, there would be nothing to prevent them from introducing additional clarifications in the last sentence of paragraph 6, as long as they do not alter its general purport.”</p>

This permits interest and other payments in respect of certain loans to be dealt with as distributions in a range of circumstances provided for in its domestic law, including those where the amount of the loan or the rate of interest or other terms relating to it are not what would have been agreed in the absence of a special relationship.”</p>
<p></paragraphsection></p>
<p id="">Paragraph 46 was amended on 21 September 1995 by adding Mexico as a country making the Reservation, reflecting a Report by the Committee on Fiscal Affairs entitled “The 1995 Update to the Model Tax Convention”. After 31 March 1994 and until 21 September 1995, paragraph 46 read as follows:“46.  As regards paragraph 6 of the Article, the <em>United Kingdom</em> reserves the right (in accordance with paragraph 35 above) to include after “exceeds” the words “for whatever reason” in place of “having regard to the debt-claim for which it is paid”. This permits interest and other payments in respect of certain loans to be dealt with as distributions in a range of circumstances provided for in its domestic law, including those where the amount of the loan or the rate of interest or other terms relating to it are not what would have been agreed in the absence of a special relationship.”</p>
<p id="">Paragraph 46 was previously amended on 31 March 1994 by the report entitled “1994 Update to the Model Tax Convention”, adopted by the OECD Council on 31 March 1994. After 23 July 1992 and until 31 March 1994, paragraph 46 read as follows:“46.  As regards paragraph 6 of the Article (see paragraph 32 above), the <em>United Kingdom</em> reserves the right to include after “exceeds” the words “for whatever reason” in place of “having regard to the debt-claim for which it is paid” so as to make it clear that abuse may occur not only where an uncommercial rate of interest is charged on the loan but also where the amount of the loan to which the interest relates exceeds that which would have been loaned between two parties acting at arm’s length.”</p>
<p>Paragraph 46 and the heading preceding it were added on 23 July 1992 by the report entitled “The Revision of the Model Convention”, adopted by the OECD Council on 23 July 1992.</p>
