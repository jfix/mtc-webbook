<h1 id="concerning-the-taxation-of-capital">CONCERNING THE TAXATION OF CAPITAL<a class="headerlink" href="#concerning-the-taxation-of-capital" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>1.  This Article deals only with taxes on capital, to the exclusion of taxes on estates and inheritances and on gifts and of transfer duties. Taxes on capital to which the Article applies are those referred to in <a href="#A002">Article 2</a>.</p>
<p id="CO022-P001"><a href="#CO022-P001-R">(Amended on 11 April 1977 see History)</a></p>
<p>2.  Taxes on capital generally constitute complementary taxation of income from capital. Consequently, taxes on a given element of capital can be levied, in principle, only by the State which is entitled to tax the income from this element of capital. However, it is not possible to refer purely and simply to the rules relating to the taxation of such class of income, for not all items of income are subject to taxation exclusively in one State.</p>
<p id="CO022-P002"><a href="#CO022-P002-R">(Amended on 11 April 1977 see History)</a></p>
<p>3.  The Article, therefore, enumerates first property which may be taxed in the State in which they are situated. To this category belong immovable property referred to in <a href="#A006">Article 6</a>which a resident of a Contracting State owns and which is situated in the other Contracting State (<a href="#A022-P001">paragraph 1</a>) and movable property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State (<a href="#A022-P002">paragraph 2</a>).</p>
<p id="CO022-P003"><a href="#CO022-P003-R">(Amended on 29 April 2000 see History)</a></p>
<p>3.1  For the purposes of paragraph 2, property will form part of the business property of a permanent establishment if the “economic” ownership of the property is allocated to that permanent establishment under the principles developed in the Committee’s report entitled *Attribution of Profits to Permanent Establishments[^67] * (see in particular paragraphs 72 to 97 of Part I of the report) for the purposes of the application of paragraph 2 of Article 7. In the context of that paragraph, the “economic” ownership of property means the equivalent of ownership for income tax purposes by a separate enterprise, with the attendant benefits and burdens (e.g.the right to any income attributable to the ownership of that property, the right to any available depreciation and the potential exposure to gains or losses from the appreciation or depreciation of that property). The mere fact that the property has been recorded, for accounting purposes, on a balance sheet prepared for the permanent establishment will therefore not be sufficient to conclude that it is effectively connected with that permanent establishment.</p>
<p id="CO022-P003.01"><a href="#CO022-P003.01-R">(Added on 22 July 2010 see History)</a></p>
<p>3.2  In the case of the permanent establishment of an enterprise carrying on insurance activities, the determination of whether property will form part of the business property of the permanent establishment shall be made by giving due regard to the guidance set forth in Part IV of the Committee’s report with respect to whether the income on or gain from that property is taken into account in determining the permanent establishment’s yield on the amount of investment assets attributed to it (see in particular paragraphs 165 to 170 of Part IV). That guidance being general in nature, tax authorities should consider applying a flexible and pragmatic approach which would take into account an enterprise’s reasonable and consistent application of that guidance for purposes of identifying the specific assets that form part of the business property of the permanent establishment.</p>
<p id="CO022-P003.02"><a href="#CO022-P003.02-R">(Added on 22 July 2010 see History)</a></p>
<p>4.  Normally, ships and aircraft operated in international traffic and boats engaged in inland waterways transport and movable property pertaining to the operation of such ships, boats or aircraft shall be taxable only in the State in which the place of effective management of the enterprise is situated (<a href="#A022-P003">paragraph 3</a>). This rule corresponds to the provisions of <a href="#A008">Article 8</a> and of <a href="#A013-P003">paragraph 3</a> of Article 13. It is understood that <a href="#A008-P003">paragraph 3</a> of Article 8 is applicable if the place of effective management of a shipping enterprise or of an inland waterways transport enterprise is aboard a ship or boat. Contracting States which would prefer to confer the exclusive taxing right on the State of residence or to use a combination of the residence criterion and the place of effective management criterion are free in bilateral conventions to substitute for <a href="#A022-P003">paragraph 3</a> a provision corresponding to those proposed in paragraphs <a href="#CO008-P002">2</a> and <a href="#CO008-P003">3</a> of the Commentary on Article 8. Immovable property pertaining to the operation of ships, boats or aircraft may be taxed in the State in which they are situated in accordance with the rule laid down in <a href="#A022-P001">paragraph 1</a>.</p>
<p id="CO022-P004"><a href="#CO022-P004-R">(Amended on 28 January 2003 see History)</a></p>
<p>4.1  Paragraph <a href="#A022-P003">3</a>applies where the enterprise that owns the property operates itself the boats, ships or aircraft referred to in the paragraph, whether for its own transportation activities or when leasing the boats, ships or aircraft on charter fully equipped, manned and supplied. It does not apply, however, where the enterprise owning the boats, ships or aircraft does not operate them (for example, where the enterprise leases the property to another person, other than in the case of an occasional bare boat lease as referred to in <a href="#CO008-P005">paragraph 5</a> of the Commentary on Article 8). In such a case, the capital will be covered by paragraph <a href="#A022-P002">2</a> or <a href="#A022-P004">4</a>.</p>
<p id="CO022-P004.01"><a href="#CO022-P004.01-R">(Added on 28 January 2003 see History)</a></p>
<p id="">4.2  In their bilateral conventions, member countries are free to clarify further the application of <a href="#A022">Article 22</a> in this situation. They might adopt the following alternative version of <a href="#A022-P003">paragraph 3</a> of the Article (see also paragraphs <a href="#CO013-P028.01">28.1</a> and <a href="#CO013-P028.02">28.2</a> of the Commentary on Article 13):3.  Capital represented by property forming part of the business property of an enterprise the place of effective management of which is situated in a Contracting State, and consisting of ships and aircraft operated by such enterprise in international traffic and of movable property pertaining to the operation of such ships and aircraft shall be taxable only in that State.</p>
<p id="CO022-P004.02"><a href="#CO022-P004.02-R">(Added on 28 January 2003 see History)</a></p>
<p>5.  As regards elements of capital other than those listed in paragraphs <a href="#A022-P001">1</a> to <a href="#A022-P003">3</a>, the Article provides that they are taxable only in the Contracting State of which the person to whom they belong is a resident (<a href="#A022-P004">paragraph 4</a>).</p>
<p id="CO022-P005"><a href="#CO022-P005-R">(Amended on 11 April 1977 see History)</a></p>
<p>6.  If, when the provisions of <a href="#A022-P004">paragraph 4</a> are applied to elements of movable property under usufruct, double taxation subsists because of the disparity between domestic laws, the States concerned may resort to the mutual agreement procedure or settle the question by means of bilateral negotiations.</p>
<p id="CO022-P006"><a href="#CO022-P006-R">(Amended on 11 April 1977 see History)</a></p>
<p>7.  The Article does not provide any rule about the deductions of debts. The laws of OECD member countries are too different to allow a common solution for such a deduction. The problem of the deduction of debts which could arise when the taxpayer and the creditor are not residents of the same State is dealt with in <a href="#A024-P004">paragraph 4</a> of Article 24.</p>
<p id="CO022-P007"><a href="#CO022-P007-R">(Amended on 23 July 1992 see History)</a></p>
<p>8.  </p>
<p id="CO022-P008"><a href="#CO022-P008-R">(Renumbered and amended on 31 March 1994 see History)</a></p>
<p><reservations><title>Reservations on the Article</title>9.  <em>Finland</em> reserves the right to tax shares or other corporate rights in Finnish companies, where the ownership of such shares or other corporate rights entitles to the enjoyment of immovable property situated in Finland and held by the company.</p>
<p id="CO022-P009"><a href="#CO022-P009-R">(Amended on 23 July 1992 see History)</a></p>
<p>10.  <em>New Zealand</em>, <em>Portugal</em> and <em>Turkey</em> reserve their positions on this Article if and when they impose taxes on capital.</p>
<p id="CO022-P010"><a href="#CO022-P010-R">(Amended on 23 July 1992 see History)</a></p>
<p>11.  <em>France</em> can accept the provisions of <a href="#A022-P004">paragraph 4</a> but wishes to retain the possibility of applying the provisions of its law relative to the taxation of shares or rights which are part of a substantial participation in a company which is a resident of France, or of shares or rights of companies the assets of which consist mainly of immovable property situated in France.</p>
<p id="CO022-P011"><a href="#CO022-P011-R">(Replaced on 23 July 1992 see History)</a></p>
<p>12.  <em>Denmark</em>, <em>Norway</em> and <em>Sweden</em> reserve the right to insert special provisions regarding capital represented by aircraft operated in international traffic, when owned by the air transport consortium Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS).</p>
<p id="CO022-P012"><a href="#CO022-P012-R">(Added on 23 July 1992 see History)</a></p>
<p>13.  <em>Spain</em> reserves its right to tax capital represented by shares or other rights in a company whose assets consist mainly of immovable property situated in Spain, by shares or other corporate rights which entitle its owner to a right of enjoyment of immovable property situated in Spain or by shares or other rights constituting a substantial participation in a company which is a resident of Spain.</p>
<p id="CO022-P013"><a href="#CO022-P013-R">(Added on 23 July 1992 see History)</a></p>
<p>14.  In view of its particular situation in relation to shipping, <em>Greece</em> will retain its freedom of action with regard to the provisions in the Convention relating to capital represented by ships in international traffic and by movable property pertaining to the operation of such ships.</p>
<p id="CO022-P014"><a href="#CO022-P014-R">(Renumbered and amended on 31 March 1994 see History)</a></p>

<p id=""><strong><a href="#CO022-P001">Paragraph 1</a></strong>: Amended when the 1977 Model Convention was adopted by the OECD Council on 11 April 1977. In the 1963 Draft Convention (adopted by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963) and until the adoption of the 1977 Model Convention, paragraph 1 read as follows:“1.  The Article deals with taxes on capital, to the exclusion of taxes on estates and inheritances and on donations and of transfer duties. Taxes on capital to which the Article applies are those specified in Article 2 concerning taxes covered by the Convention.”</p>
<p id=""><strong><a href="#CO022-P002">Paragraph 2</a></strong>: Amended when the 1977 Model Convention was adopted by the OECD Council on 11 April 1977. In the 1963 Draft Convention (adopted by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963) and until the adoption of the 1977 Model Convention, paragraph 2 read as follows:“2.  Taxes on capital generally constitute supplementary taxation of income from capital. Consequently, taxes on capital can be levied, in principle, only by the State which is entitled to tax the income from the capital. However, it is not possible to refer purely and simply to the rules relating to the taxation of the income, for not all income is subject to taxation exclusively in one State.”</p>
<p id=""><strong><a href="#CO022-P003">Paragraph 3</a></strong>: Amended on 29 April 2000 by the report entitled “The 2000 Update to the Model Tax Convention”, adopted by the OECD Committee on Fiscal Affairs on 29 April 2000 on the basis of the Annex of another report entitled “Issues Related to Article 14 of the OECD Model Tax Convention” (adopted by the OECD Committee on Fiscal Affairs on 27 January 2000). In the 1977 Model Convention and until 29 April 2000, paragraph 3 read as follows:“3.  The Article, therefore, enumerates first property which may be taxed in the State in which they are situated. To this category belong immovable property referred to in Article 6 which a resident of a Contracting State owns and which is situated in the other Contracting State (paragraph 1), and movable property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State, or pertaining to a fixed base which a resident of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State for the performance of independent personal services (paragraph 2).”</p>
<p id="">Paragraph 3 was previously amended when the 1977 Model Convention was adopted by the OECD Council on 11 April 1977. In the 1963 Draft Convention (adopted by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963) and until the adoption of the 1977 Model Convention, paragraph 3 read as follows:“3.  The Article, therefore, enumerates first property and assets which may be taxed in the State in which they are situated. To this category belong immovable property, as defined in Article 6 on the taxation of income from immovable property, and movable property forming part of the business property employed in a permanent establishment of an enterprise, or pertaining to a fixed base used for the performance of professional services (paragraphs 1 and 2).”</p>
<p><strong><a href="#CO022-P003.01">Paragraph 3.1</a></strong>: Added on 22 July 2010 by the report entitled the “2010 Update to the Model Tax Convention” adopted by the OECD Council on 22 July 2010.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#CO022-P003.02">Paragraph 3.2</a></strong>: Added on 22 July 2010 by the report entitled the “2010 Update to the Model Tax Convention” adopted by the OECD Council on 22 July 2010.</p>
<p id=""><strong><a href="#CO022-P004">Paragraph 4</a></strong>: Amended on 28 January 2003, by adding the word “Normally” at the beginning of the paragraph, by the report entitled “The 2002 Update to the Model Tax Convention” adopted by the OECD Council on 28 January 2003. In the 1977 Model Convention and until 28 January 2003, paragraph 4 read as follows:“4.  Ships and aircraft operated in international traffic and boats engaged in inland waterways transport and movable property pertaining to the operation of such ships, boats or aircraft shall be taxable only in the State in which the place of effective management of the enterprise is situated (paragraph 3). This rule corresponds to the provisions of Article 8 and of paragraph 3 of Article 13. It is understood that paragraph 3 of Article 8 is applicable if the place of effective management of a shipping enterprise or of an inland waterways transport enterprise is aboard a ship or boat. Contracting States which would prefer to confer the exclusive taxing right on the State of residence or to use a combination of the residence criterion and the place of effective management criterion are free in bilateral conventions to substitute for paragraph 3 a provision corresponding to those proposed in paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Commentary on Article 8. Immovable property pertaining to the operation of ships, boats or aircraft may be taxed in the State in which they are situated in accordance with the rule laid down in paragraph 1.”</p>
<p id="">Paragraph 4 was previously amended when the 1977 Model Convention was adopted by the OECD Council on 11 April 1977. In the 1963 Draft Convention (adopted by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963) and until the adoption of the 1977 Model Convention, paragraph 4 read as follows:“4.  Ships and aircraft operated in international traffic and boats engaged in inland waterways transport and assets, other than immovable property, pertaining to the operation of such ships, aircraft and boats are taxable only in the State in which the effective place of management of the enterprise is situated (paragraph 3). This rule is based on the provisions of Article 8 on taxation of income from shipping, inland waterways transport and air transport. It is understood that paragraph 3 of Article 8 concerning shipping, inland waterways transport and air transport, is applicable if the place of effective management of a shipping enterprise or of an inland waterways transport enterprise is aboard a ship or boat. Immovable property pertaining to the operation of ships, aircraft and boats, may be taxed in the State in which they are situated, in accordance with the rule laid down in paragraph 1.”</p>
<p><strong><a href="#CO022-P004.01">Paragraph 4.1</a></strong>: Added on 28 January 2003 by the report entitled “The 2002 Update to the Model Tax Convention”, adopted by the OECD Council on 28 January 2003.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#CO022-P004.02">Paragraph 4.2</a></strong>: Added on 28 January 2003 by the report entitled “The 2002 Update to the Model Tax Convention”, adopted by the OECD Council on 28 January 2003.</p>
<p id=""><strong><a href="#CO022-P005">Paragraph 5</a></strong>: Amended when the 1977 Model Convention was adopted by the OECD Council on 11 April 1977. In the 1963 Draft Convention (adopted by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963) and until the adoption of the 1977 Model Convention, paragraph 5 read as follows:“5.  As regards other elements of capital than those listed in paragraphs 1 to 3, the Article provides that they are taxable only in the State of which the person to whom they belong is a resident (paragraph 4).”</p>
<p id=""><strong><a href="#CO022-P006">Paragraph 6</a></strong>: Amended when the 1977 Model Convention was adopted by the OECD Council on 11 April 1977. In the 1963 Draft Convention (adopted by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963) and until the adoption of the 1977 Model Convention, paragraph 6 read as follows:“6.  If, following the application of paragraph 4 to elements of movable property under usufruct, double taxation subsists because of the disparity between national laws, the States concerned may resort to the mutual agreement procedure or settle the question by means of bilateral negotiations.”</p>
<p id=""><strong><a href="#CO022-P007">Paragraph 7</a></strong>: Amended on 23 July 1992, by replacing the reference therein to paragraph 5 of Article 24 with a reference to paragraph 4 of that Article, by the report entitled “The Revision of the Model Convention”, adopted by the OECD Council on 23 July 1992. In the 1977 Model Convention and until 23 July 1992, paragraph 7 read as follows:“7.  The Article does not provide any rule about the deductions of debts. The laws of OECD member countries are too different to allow a common solution for such a deduction. The problem of the deduction of debts which could arise when the taxpayer and the creditor are not residents of the same State is dealt with in paragraph 5 of Article 24.”</p>
