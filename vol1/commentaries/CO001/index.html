<p>1.  Whereas the earliest conventions in general were applicable to “citizens” of the Contracting States, more recent conventions usually apply to “residents” of one or both of the Contracting States irrespective of nationality. Some conventions are of even wider scope because they apply more generally to “taxpayers” of the Contracting States; they are, therefore, also applicable to persons, who, although not residing in either State, are nevertheless liable to tax on part of their income or capital in each of them. It has been deemed preferable for practical reasons to provide that the Convention is to apply to persons who are residents of one or both of the Contracting States. The term “resident” is defined in <a href="#A004">Article 4</a>.</p>

<p>2.  Domestic laws differ in the treatment of partnerships. These differences create various difficulties when applying tax Conventions in relation to partnerships. These difficulties are analysed in the report by the Committee on Fiscal Affairs entitled “<a href="#EMPTY">!!!! NEED TO LINK WITH REPORT !!!!</a>”,[^11] the conclusions of which have been incorporated below and in the Commentary on various other provisions of the Model Tax Convention.</p>
<p id="CO001-P002"><a href="#CO001-P002-R">(Replaced on 29 April 2000 see History)</a></p>
<p>3.  As discussed in that report, a main source of difficulties is the fact that some countries treat partnerships as taxable units (sometimes even as companies) whereas other countries adopt what may be referred to as the fiscally transparent approach, under which the partnership is ignored for tax purposes and the individual partners are taxed on their respective share of the partnership’s income.</p>
<p id="CO001-P003"><a href="#CO001-P003-R">(Replaced on 29 April 2000 see History)</a></p>
<p>4.  A first difficulty is the extent to which a partnership is entitled as such to the benefits of the provisions of the Convention. Under <a href="#A001">Article 1</a>, only persons who are residents of the Contracting States are entitled to the benefits of the tax Convention entered into by these States. While <a href="#CO003-P002">paragraph 2</a> of the Commentary on <a href="#A003">3</a> explains why a partnership constitutes a person, a partnership does not necessarily qualify as a resident of a Contracting State under <a href="#A004">Article 4</a>.</p>
<p id="CO001-P004"><a href="#CO001-P004-R">(Replaced on 29 April 2000 see History)</a></p>
<p>5.  Where a partnership is treated as a company or taxed in the same way, it is a resident of the Contracting State that taxes the partnership on the grounds mentioned in <a href="#A004-P001">paragraph 1</a> of <a href="#A004">Article 4</a> and, therefore, it is entitled to the benefits of the Convention. Where, however, a partnership is treated as fiscally transparent in a State, the partnership is not “liable to tax” in that State within the meaning of <a href="#A004-P001">paragraph 1</a> of <a href="#A004">Article 4</a>, and so cannot be a resident thereof for purposes of the Convention. In such a case, the application of the Convention to the partnership as such would be refused, unless a special rule covering partnerships were provided for in the Convention. Where the application of the Convention is so refused, the partners should be entitled, with respect to their share of the income of the partnership, to the benefits provided by the Conventions entered into by the States of which they are residents to the extent that the partnership’s income is allocated to them for the purposes of taxation in their State of residence (see <a href="#CO004-P008.08">paragraph 8.8</a> of the <a href="#CO004">Commentary on Article 4</a>).</p>
<p id="CO001-P005"><a href="#CO001-P005-R">(Amended on 17 July 2008 see History)</a></p>
<p>6.  The relationship between the partnership’s entitlement to the benefits of a tax Convention and that of the partners raises other questions.</p>
<p id="CO001-P006"><a href="#CO001-P006-R">(Replaced on 29 April 2000 see History)</a></p>
<p>6.1  One issue is the effect that the application of the provisions of the Convention to a partnership can have on the taxation of the partners. Where a partnership is treated as a resident of a Contracting State, the provisions of the Convention that restrict the other Contracting State’s right to tax the partnership on its income do not apply to restrict that other State’s right to tax the partners who are its own residents on their share of the income of the partnership. Some states may wish to include in their conventions a provision that expressly confirms a Contracting State’s right to tax resident partners on their share of the income of a partnership that is treated as a resident of the other State.</p>
<p id="CO001-P006.01"><a href="#CO001-P006.01-R">(Added on 29 April 2000 see History)</a></p>
<p>6.2  Another issue is that of the effect of the provisions of the Convention on a Contracting State’s right to tax income arising on its territory where the entitlement to the benefits of one, or more than one, Conventions is different for the partners and the partnership. Where, for instance, the State of source treats a domestic partnership as fiscally transparent and therefore taxes the partners on their share of the income of the partnership, a partner that is resident of a State that taxes partnerships as companies would not be able to claim the benefits of the Convention between the two States with respect to the share of the partnership’s income that the State of source taxes in his hands since that income, though allocated to the person claiming the benefits of the Convention under the laws of the State of source, is not similarly allocated for purposes of determining the liability to tax on that item of income in the State of residence of that person.</p>
<p id="CO001-P006.02"><a href="#CO001-P006.02-R">(Added on 29 April 2000 see History)</a></p>
<p>6.3  The results described in the preceding paragraph should obtain even if, as a matter of the domestic law of the State of source, the partnership would not be regarded as transparent for tax purposes but as a separate taxable entity to which the income would be attributed, provided that the partnership is not actually considered as a resident of the State of source. This conclusion is founded upon the principle that the State of source should take into account, as part of the factual context in which the Convention is to be applied, the way in which an item of income, arising in its jurisdiction, is treated in the jurisdiction of the person claiming the benefits of the Convention as a resident. For States which could not agree with this interpretation of the Article, it would be possible to provide for this result in a special provision which would avoid the resulting potential double taxation where the income of the partnership is differently allocated by the two States.</p>
<p id="CO001-P006.03"><a href="#CO001-P006.03-R">(Added on 29 April 2000 see History)</a></p>
<p>6.4  Where, as described in <a href="#CO001-P006.02">paragraph 6.2</a>, income has “flowed through” a transparent partnership to the partners who are liable to tax on that income in the State of their residence then the income is appropriately viewed as “paid” to the partners since it is to them and not to the partnership that the income is allocated for purposes of determining their tax liability in their State of residence. Hence the partners, in these circumstances, satisfy the condition, imposed in several Articles, that the income concerned is “paid to a resident of the other Contracting State”. Similarly the requirement, imposed by some other Articles, that income or gains are “derived by a resident of the other Contracting State” is met in the circumstances described above. This interpretation avoids denying the benefits of tax Conventions to a partnership’s income on the basis that neither the partnership, because it is not a resident, nor the partners, because the income is not directly paid to them or derived by them, can claim the benefits of the Convention with respect to that income. Following from the principle discussed in <a href="#CO001-P006.03">paragraph 6.3</a>, the conditions that the income be paid to, or derived by, a resident should be considered to be satisfied even where, as a matter of the domestic law of the State of source, the partnership would not be regarded as transparent for tax purposes, provided that the partnership is not actually considered as a resident of the State of source.</p>
<p id="CO001-P006.04"><a href="#CO001-P006.04-R">(Added on 29 April 2000 see History)</a></p>
<p>6.5  Partnership cases involving three States pose difficult problems with respect to the determination of entitlement to benefits under Conventions. However, many problems may be solved through the application of the principles described in <a href="#CO001-P006.02">paragraphs 6.2</a> to <a href="#CO001-P006.04">6.4</a>. Where a partner is a resident of one State, the partnership is established in another State and the partner shares in partnership income arising in a third State then the partner may claim the benefits of the Convention between his State of residence and the State of source of the income to the extent that the partnership’s income is allocated to him for the purposes of taxation in his State of residence. If, in addition, the partnership is taxed as a resident of the State in which it is established then the partnership may itself claim the benefits of the Convention between the State in which it is established and the State of source. In such a case of “double benefits”, the State of source may not impose taxation which is inconsistent with the terms of either applicable Convention; therefore, where different rates are provided for in the two Conventions, the lower will be applied. However, Contracting States may wish to consider special provisions to deal with the administration of benefits under Conventions in situations such as these, so that the partnership may claim benefits but partners could not present concurrent claims. Such provisions could ensure appropriate and simplified administration of the giving of benefits. No benefits will be available under the Convention between the State in which the partnership is established and the State of source if the partnership is regarded as transparent for tax purposes by the State in which it is established. Similarly no benefits will be available under the Convention between the State of residence of the partner and the State of source if the income of the partnership is not allocated to the partner under the taxation law of the State of residence. If the partnership is regarded as transparent for tax purposes by the State in which it is established and the income of the partnership is not allocated to the partner under the taxation law of the State of residence of the partner, the State of source may tax partnership income allocable to the partner without restriction.</p>
<p id="CO001-P006.05"><a href="#CO001-P006.05-R">(Added on 29 April 2000 see History)</a></p>
<p>6.6  Differences in how countries apply the fiscally transparent approach may create other difficulties for the application of tax Conventions. Where a State considers that a partnership does not qualify as a resident of a Contracting State because it is not liable to tax and the partners are liable to tax in their State of residence on their share of the partnership’s income, it is expected that that State will apply the provisions of the Convention as if the partners had earned the income directly so that the classification of the income for purposes of the allocative rules of Articles <a href="#A006">6</a> to <a href="#A021">21</a> will not be modified by the fact that the income flows through the partnership. Difficulties may arise, however, in the application of provisions which refer to the activities of the taxpayer, the nature of the taxpayer, the relationship between the taxpayer and another party to a transaction. Some of these difficulties are discussed in <a href="#CO005-P019.01">paragraph 19.1</a> of the Commentary on Article 5 and paragraphs <a href="#CO015-P006.01">6.1</a> and <a href="#CO001-P006.02">6.2</a> of the Commentary on Article 15.</p>
<p id="CO001-P006.06"><a href="#CO001-P006.06-R">(Added on 29 April 2000 see History)</a></p>
<p>6.7  Finally, a number of other difficulties arise where different rules of the Convention are applied by the Contracting States to income derived by a partnership or its partners, depending on the domestic laws of these States or their interpretation of the provisions of the Convention or of the relevant facts. These difficulties relate to the broader issue of conflicts of qualification, which is dealt with in paragraphs <a href="#CO023A-023B-P032.01">32.1</a> ff. and <a href="#CO023A-023B-P056.01">56.1</a> ff. of the Commentary on Article <a href="#CO023A-023B">!!!!

<p>6.8  Most countries have dealt with the domestic tax issues arising from groups of small investors who pool their funds in collective investment vehicles (CIVs). In general, the goal of such systems is to provide for neutrality between direct investments and investments through a CIV. Whilst those systems generally succeed when the investors, the CIV and the investment are all located in the same country, complications frequently arise when one or more of those parties or the investments are located in different countries. These complications are discussed in the report by the Committee on Fiscal Affairs entitled “The Granting of Treaty Benefits with Respect to the Income of Collective Investment Vehicles”,[^12] the main conclusions of which have been incorporated below. For purposes of the Report and for this discussion, the term “CIV” is limited to funds that are widely-held, hold a diversified portfolio of securities and are subject to investor-protection regulation in the country in which they are established.</p>
<p id="CO001-P006.08"><a href="#CO001-P006.08-R">(Added on 22 July 2010 see History)</a></p>
<p><title>Application of the Convention to CIVs</title>6.9  The primary question that arises in the cross-border context is whether a CIV should qualify for the benefits of the Convention in its own right. In order to do so under treaties that, like the Convention, do not include a specific provision dealing with CIVs, a CIV would have to qualify as a “person” that is a “resident” of a Contracting State and, as regards the application of <a href="#A010">Articles 10</a> and <a href="#A011">11</a>, that is the “beneficial owner” of the income that it receives.</p>
<p id="CO001-P006.09"><a href="#CO001-P006.09-R">(Added on 22 July 2010 see History)</a></p>
<p>6.10  The determination of whether a CIV should be treated as a “person” begins with the legal form of the CIV, which differs substantially from country to country and between the various types of vehicles. In many countries, most CIVs take the form of a company. In others, the CIV typically would be a trust. In still others, many CIVs are simple contractual arrangements or a form of joint ownership. In most cases, the CIV would be treated as a taxpayer or a “person” for purposes of the tax law of the State in which it is established; for example, in some countries where the CIV is commonly established in the form of a trust, either the trust itself, or the trustees acting collectively in their capacity as such, is treated as a taxpayer or a person for domestic tax law purposes. In view of the wide meaning to be given to the term “person”, the fact that the tax law of the country where such a CIV is established would treat it as a taxpayer would be indicative that the CIV is a “person” for treaty purposes. Contracting States wishing to expressly clarify that, in these circumstances, such CIVs are persons for the purposes of their conventions may agree bilaterally to modify the definition of “person” to include them.</p>
<p id="CO001-P006.10"><a href="#CO001-P006.10-R">(Added on 22 July 2010 see History)</a></p>
<p>6.11  Whether a CIV is a “resident” of a Contracting State depends not on its legal form (as long as it qualifies as a person) but on its tax treatment in the State in which it is established. Although a consistent goal of domestic CIV regimes is to ensure that there is only one level of tax, at either the CIV or the investor level, there are a number of different ways in which States achieve that goal. In some States, the holders of interests in the CIV are liable to tax on the income received by the CIV, rather than the CIV itself being liable to tax on such income. Such a fiscally transparent CIV would not be treated as a resident of the Contracting State in which it is established because it is not liable to tax therein.</p>
<p id="CO011-P006.11"><a href="#CO001-P006.11-R">(Added on 22 July 2010 see History)</a></p>
<p>6.12  By contrast, in other States, a CIV is in principle liable to tax but its income may be fully exempt, for instance, if the CIV fulfils certain criteria with regard to its purpose, activities or operation, which may include requirements as to minimum distributions, its sources of income and sometimes its sectors of operation. More frequently, CIVs are subject to tax but the base for taxation is reduced, in a variety of different ways, by reference to distributions paid to investors. Deductions for distributions will usually mean that no tax is in fact paid. Other States tax CIVs but at a special low tax rate. Finally, some States tax CIVs fully but with integration at the investor level to avoid double taxation of the income of the CIV. For those countries that adopt the view, reflected in <a href="#CO004-P008.06">paragraph 8.6</a> of the Commentary on Article 4, that a person may be liable to tax even if the State in which it is established does not impose tax, the CIV would be treated as a resident of the State in which it is established in all of these cases because the CIV is subject to comprehensive taxation in that State. Even in the case where the income of the CIV is taxed at a zero rate, or is exempt from tax, the requirements to be treated as a resident may be met if the requirements to qualify for such lower rate or exemption are sufficiently stringent.</p>
<p id="CO001-P006.12"><a href="#CO001-P006.12-R">(Added on 22 July 2010 see History)</a></p>
<p>6.13  Those countries that adopt the alternative view, reflected in <a href="#CO004-P008.07">paragraph 8.7</a> of the Commentary on Article 4, that an entity that is exempt from tax therefore is not liable to tax may not view some or all of the CIVs described in the preceding paragraph as residents of the States in which they are established. States taking the latter view, and those States negotiating with such States, are encouraged to address the issue in their bilateral negotiations.</p>
<p id="CO001-P006.13"><a href="#CO001-P006.13-R">(Added on 22 July 2010 see History)</a></p>
<p>6.14  Some countries have questioned whether a CIV, even if it is a “person” and a “resident”, can qualify as the beneficial owner of the income it receives. Because a “CIV” as defined in <a href="#CO001-P006.08">paragraph 6.8</a> above must be widely-held, hold a diversified portfolio of securities and be subject to investor-protection regulation in the country in which it is established, such a CIV, or its managers, often perform significant functions with respect to the investment and management of the assets of the CIV. Moreover, the position of an investor in a CIV differs substantially, as a legal and economic matter, from the position of an investor who owns the underlying assets, so that it would not be appropriate to treat the investor in such a CIV as the beneficial owner of the income received by the CIV. Accordingly, a vehicle that meets the definition of a widely-held CIV will also be treated as the beneficial owner of the dividends and interest that it receives, so long as the managers of the CIV have discretionary powers to manage the assets generating such income (unless an individual who is a resident of that State who would have received the income in the same circumstances would not have been considered to be the beneficial owner thereof).</p>
<p id="CO001-P006.14"><a href="#CO001-P006.14-R">(Added on 22 July 2010 see History)</a></p>
<p>6.15  Because these principles are necessarily general, their application to a particular type of CIV might not be clear to the CIV, investors and intermediaries. Any uncertainty regarding treaty eligibility is especially problematic for a CIV, which must take into account amounts expected to be received, including any withholding tax benefits provided by treaty, when it calculates its net asset value (“NAV”). The NAV, which typically is calculated daily, is the basis for the prices used for subscriptions and redemptions. If the withholding tax benefits ultimately obtained by the CIV do not correspond to its original assumptions about the amount and timing of such withholding tax benefits, there will be a discrepancy between the real asset value and the NAV used by investors who have purchased, sold or redeemed their interests in the CIV in the interim.</p>

<p>6.16  In order to provide more certainty under existing treaties, tax authorities may want to reach a mutual agreement clarifying the treatment of some types of CIVs in their respective States. With respect to some types of CIVs, such a mutual agreement might simply confirm that the CIV satisfies the technical requirements discussed above and therefore is entitled to benefits in its own right. In other cases, the mutual agreement could provide a CIV an administratively feasible way to make claims with respect to treaty-eligible investors (see paragraphs 36 to 40 of the report “The Granting of Treaty Benefits with Respect to the Income of Collective Investment Vehicles” for a discussion of this issue). Of course, a mutual agreement could not cut back on benefits that otherwise would be available to the CIV under the terms of a treaty.</p>

<p id=""><title>Policy issues raised by the current treatment of collective investment vehicles</title>6.17  The same considerations would suggest that treaty negotiators address expressly the treatment of CIVs. Thus, even if it appears that CIVs in each of the Contracting States would be entitled to benefits, it may be appropriate to confirm that position publicly (for example, through an exchange of notes) in order to provide certainty. It may also be appropriate to expressly provide for the treaty entitlement of CIVs by including, for example, a provision along the following lines:Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Convention, a collective investment vehicle which is established in a Contracting State and which receives income arising in the other Contracting State shall be treated, for purposes of applying the Convention to such income, as an individual who is a resident of the Contracting State in which it is established and as the beneficial owner of the income it receives (provided that, if an individual who is a resident of the first-mentioned State had received the income in the same circumstances, such individual would have been considered to be the beneficial owner thereof). For purposes of this paragraph, the term “collective investment vehicle” means, in the case of [State A], a [  ] and, in the case of [State B], a [  ], as well as any other investment fund, arrangement or entity established in either Contracting State which the competent authorities of the Contracting States agree to regard as a collective investment vehicle for purposes of this paragraph.</p>
<p id="CO001-P006.17"><a href="#CO001-P006.17-R">(Added on 22 July 2010 see History)</a></p>
<p>6.18  However, in negotiating new treaties or amendments to existing treaties, the Contracting States would not be restricted to clarifying the results of the application of other treaty provisions to CIVs, but could vary those results to the extent necessary to achieve policy objectives. For example, in the context of a particular bilateral treaty, the technical analysis may result in CIVs located in one of the Contracting States qualifying for benefits, whilst CIVs in the other Contracting State may not. This may make the treaty appear unbalanced, although whether it is so in fact will depend on the specific circumstances. If it is, then the Contracting States should attempt to reach an equitable solution. If the practical result in each of the Contracting States is that most CIVs do not in fact pay tax, then the Contracting States should attempt to overcome differences in legal form that might otherwise cause those in one State to qualify for benefits and those in the other to be denied benefits. On the other hand, the differences in legal form and tax treatment in the two Contracting States may mean that it is appropriate to treat CIVs in the two States differently. In comparing the taxation of CIVs in the two States, taxation in the source State and at the investor level should be considered, not just the taxation of the CIV itself. The goal is to achieve neutrality between a direct investment and an investment through a CIV in the international context, just as the goal of most domestic provisions addressing the treatment of CIVs is to achieve such neutrality in the wholly domestic context.</p>

<p>6.19  A Contracting State may also want to consider whether existing treaty provisions are sufficient to prevent CIVs from being used in a potentially abusive manner. It is possible that a CIV could satisfy all of the requirements to claim treaty benefits in its own right, even though its income is not subject to much, if any, tax in practice. In that case, the CIV could present the opportunity for residents of third countries to receive treaty benefits that would not have been available had they invested directly. Accordingly, it may be appropriate to restrict benefits that might otherwise be available to such a CIV, either through generally applicable anti-abuse or anti-treaty shopping rules (as discussed under “Improper use of the Convention” below) or through a specific provision dealing with CIVs.</p>
<p id="CO001-P006.19"><a href="#CO001-P006.19-R">(Added on 22 July 2010 see History)</a></p>
<p>6.20  In deciding whether such a provision is necessary, Contracting States will want to consider the economic characteristics, including the potential for treaty shopping, presented by the various types of CIVs that are prevalent in each of the Contracting States. For example, a CIV that is not subject to any taxation in the State in which it is established may present more of a danger of treaty shopping than one in which the CIV itself is subject to an entity-level tax or where distributions to non-resident investors are subject to withholding tax.</p>

<p><title>Possible provisions modifying the treatment of CIVs</title>6.21  Where the Contracting States have agreed that a specific provision dealing with CIVs is necessary to address the concerns described in paragraphs <a href="#CO001-P006.18">6.18</a> through <a href="#CO001-P006.20">6.20</a>, they could include in the bilateral treaty the following provision:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Convention, a collective investment vehicle which is established in a Contracting State and which receives income arising in the other Contracting State shall be treated for purposes of applying the Convention to such income as an individual who is a resident of the Contracting State in which it is established and as the beneficial owner of the income it receives (provided that, if an individual who is a resident of the first-mentioned State had received the income in the same circumstances, such individual would have been considered to be the beneficial owner thereof), but only to the extent that the beneficial interests in the collective investment vehicle are owned by equivalent beneficiaries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this paragraph:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>the term “collective investment vehicle” means, in the case of [State A], a [  ] and, in the case of [State B], a [  ], as well as any other investment fund, arrangement or entity established in either Contracting State which the competent authorities of the Contracting States agree to regard as a collective investment vehicle for purposes of this paragraph; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the term “equivalent beneficiary” means a resident of the Contracting State in which the CIV is established, and a resident of any other State with which the Contracting State in which the income arises has an income tax convention that provides for effective and comprehensive information exchange who would, if he received the particular item of income for which benefits are being claimed under this Convention, be entitled under that convention, or under the domestic law of the Contracting State in which the income arises, to a rate of tax with respect to that item of income that is at least as low as the rate claimed under this Convention by the CIV with respect to that item of income.</p>

<p>6.22  It is intended that the Contracting States would provide in subdivision <em>b</em>)(<em>i</em>) specific cross-references to relevant tax or securities law provisions relating to CIVs. In deciding which treatment should apply with respect to particular CIVs, Contracting States should take into account the policy considerations discussed above. Negotiators may agree that economic differences in the treatment of CIVs in the two Contracting States, or even within the same Contracting State, justify differential treatment in the tax treaty. In that case, some combination of the provisions in this section might be included in the treaty.</p>
<p id="CO001-P006.22"><a href="#CO001-P006.22-R">(Added on 22 July 2010 see History)</a></p>
<p>6.23  The effect of allowing benefits to the CIV to the extent that it is owned by “equivalent beneficiaries” as defined in subdivision b)(ii) is to ensure that investors who would have been entitled to benefits with respect to income derived from the source State had they received the income directly are not put in a worse position by investing through a CIV located in a third country. The approach thus serves the goals of neutrality as between direct investments and investments through a CIV. It also decreases the risk of double taxation as between the source State and the State of residence of the investor, to the extent that there is a tax treaty between them. It is beneficial for investors, particularly those from small countries, who will consequently enjoy a greater choice of investment vehicles. It also increases economies of scale, which are a primary economic benefit of investing through CIVs. Finally, adopting this approach substantially simplifies compliance procedures. In many cases, nearly all of a CIV’s investors will be “equivalent beneficiaries”, given the extent of bilateral treaty coverage and the fact that rates in those treaties are nearly always 10-15 per cent on portfolio dividends.</p>
<p id="CO001-P006.23"><a href="#CO001-P006.23-R">(Added on 22 July 2010 see History)</a></p>
<p>6.24  At the same time, the provision prevents a CIV from being used by investors to achieve a better tax treaty position than they would have achieved by investing directly. This is achieved through the rate comparison in the definition of “equivalent beneficiary”. Accordingly, the appropriate comparison is between the rate claimed by the CIV and the rate that the investor could have claimed had it received the income directly. For example, assume that a CIV established in State B receives dividends from a company resident in State A. Sixty-five per cent of the investors in the CIV are individual residents of State B; ten per cent are pension funds established in State C and 25 per cent are individual residents of State C. Under the A-B tax treaty, portfolio dividends are subject to a maximum tax rate at source of ten per cent. Under the A-C tax treaty, pension funds are exempt from taxation in the source State and other portfolio dividends are subject to tax at a maximum tax rate of 15 per cent. Both the A‑B and A-C treaties include effective and comprehensive information exchange provisions. On these facts, 75 per cent of the investors in the CIV — the individual residents of State B and the pension funds established in State C — are equivalent beneficiaries.</p>
<p id="CO001-P006.24"><a href="#CO001-P006.24-R">(Added on 22 July 2010 see History)</a></p>
<p>6.25  A source State may also be concerned about the potential deferral of taxation that could arise with respect to a CIV that is subject to no or low taxation and that may accumulate its income rather than distributing it on a current basis. Such States may be tempted to limit benefits to the CIV to the proportion of the CIV’s investors who are currently taxable on their share of the income of the CIV. However, such an approach has proven difficult to apply to widely-held CIVs in practice. Those States that are concerned about the possibility of such deferral may wish to negotiate provisions that extend benefits only to those CIVs that are required to distribute earnings currently. Other States may be less concerned about the potential for deferral, however. They may take the view that, even if the investor is not taxed currently on the income received by the CIV, it will be taxed eventually, either on the distribution, or on any capital gains if it sells its interest in the CIV before the CIV distributes the income. Those States may wish to negotiate provisions that grant benefits to CIVs even if they are not obliged to distribute their income on a current basis. Moreover, in many States, the tax rate with respect to investment income is not significantly higher than the treaty withholding rate on dividends, so there would be little, if any, residence State tax deferral to be achieved by earning such income through an investment fund rather than directly. In addition, many States have taken steps to ensure the current taxation of investment income earned by their residents through investment funds, regardless of whether the funds accumulate that income, further reducing the potential for such deferral. When considering the treatment of CIVs that are not required to distribute income currently, States may want to consider whether these or other factors address the concerns described above so that the type of limits described herein might not in fact be necessary.</p>

<p>6.26  Some States believe that taking all treaty-eligible investors, including those in third States, into account would change the bilateral nature of tax treaties. These States may prefer to allow treaty benefits to a CIV only to the extent that the investors in the CIV are residents of the Contracting State in which the CIV is established. In that case, the provision would be drafted as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Convention, a collective investment vehicle which is established in a Contracting State and which receives income arising in the other Contracting State shall be treated for purposes of applying the Convention to such income as an individual who is a resident of the Contracting State in which it is established and as the beneficial owner of the income it receives (provided that, if an individual who is a resident of the first-mentioned State had received the income in the same circumstances, such individual would have been considered to be the beneficial owner thereof), but only to the extent that the beneficial interests in the collective investment vehicle are owned by residents of the Contracting State in which the collective investment vehicle is established.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this paragraph, the term “collective investment vehicle” means, in the case of [State A], a [  ] and, in the case of [State B], a [  ], as well as any other investment fund, arrangement or entity established in either Contracting State which the competent authorities of the Contracting States agree to regard as a collective investment vehicle for purposes of this paragraph.</p>

<p id="CO001-P006.26"><a href="#CO001-P006.26-R">(Added on 22 July 2010 see History)</a></p>
<p id="">6.27  Although the purely proportionate approach set out in paragraphs <a href="#CO001-P006.21">6.21</a>and <a href="#CO001-P006.26">6.26</a> protects against treaty shopping, it may also impose substantial administrative burdens as a CIV attempts to determine the treaty entitlement of every single investor. A Contracting State may decide that the fact that a substantial proportion of the CIV’s investors are treaty-eligible is adequate protection against treaty shopping, and thus that it is appropriate to provide an ownership threshold above which benefits would be provided with respect to all income received by the CIV. Including such a threshold would also mitigate some of the procedural burdens that otherwise might arise. If desired, therefore, the following sentence could be added at the end of subparagraph <em>a</em>):However, if at least [  ] per cent of the beneficial interests in the collective investment vehicle are owned by [equivalent beneficiaries][residents of the Contracting State in which the collective investment vehicle is established], the collective investment vehicle shall be treated as an individual who is a resident of the Contracting State in which it is established and as the beneficial owner of all of the income it receives (provided that, if an individual who is a resident of the first-mentioned State had received the income in the same circumstances, such individual would have been considered to be the beneficial owner thereof).</p>
<p id="CO001-P006.27"><a href="#CO001-P006.27-R">(Added on 22 July 2010 see History)</a></p>
<p>6.28  In some cases, the Contracting States might wish to take a different approach from that put forward in paragraphs <a href="#CO001-P006.17">6.17</a>, <a href="#CO001-P006.21">6.21</a> and <a href="#CO001-P006.26">6.26</a> with respect to certain types of CIVs and to treat the CIV as making claims on behalf of the investors rather than in its own name. This might be true, for example, if a large percentage of the owners of interests in the CIV as a whole, or of a class of interests in the CIV, are pension funds that are exempt from tax in the source country under terms of the relevant treaty similar to those described in <a href="#CO018-P069">paragraph 69</a> of the Commentary on Article 18. To ensure that the investors would not lose the benefit of the preferential rates to which they would have been entitled had they invested directly, the Contracting States might agree to a provision along the following lines with respect to such CIVs (although likely adopting one of the approaches of paragraph <a href="#CO001-P006.17">6.17</a>, <a href="#CO001-P006.21">6.21</a> or <a href="#CO001-P006.26">6.26</a> with respect to other types of CIVs):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A collective investment vehicle described in subparagraph <em>c</em>) which is established in a Contracting State and which receives income arising in the other Contracting State shall not be treated as a resident of the Contracting State in which it is established, but may claim, on behalf of the owners of the beneficial interests in the collective investment vehicle, the tax reductions, exemptions or other benefits that would have been available under this Convention to such owners had they received such income directly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A collective investment vehicle may not make a claim under subparagraph <em>a</em>) for benefits on behalf of any owner of the beneficial interests in such collective investment vehicle if the owner has itself made an individual claim for benefits with respect to income received by the collective investment vehicle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This paragraph shall apply with respect to, in the case of [State A], a [  ] and, in the case of [State B], a [  ], as well as any other investment fund, arrangement or entity established in either Contracting State to which the competent authorities of the Contracting States agree to apply this paragraph.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This provision would, however, limit the CIV to making claims on behalf of residents of the same Contracting State in which the CIV is established. If, for the reasons described in <a href="#CO001-P006.23">paragraph 6.23</a>, the Contracting States deemed it desirable to allow the CIV to make claims on behalf of treaty-eligible residents of third States, that could be accomplished by replacing the words “this Convention” with “any Convention to which the other Contracting State is a party” in subparagraph <em>a</em>). If, as anticipated, the Contracting States would agree that the treatment provided in this paragraph would apply only to specific types of CIVs, it would be necessary to ensure that the types of CIVs listed in subparagraph <em>c</em>) did not include any of the types of CIVs listed in a more general provision such as that in paragraph <a href="#CO001-P006.17">6.17</a>, <a href="#CO001-P006.21">6.21</a> or <a href="#CO001-P006.26">6.26</a> so that the treatment of a specific type of CIV would be fixed, rather than elective. Countries wishing to allow individual CIVs to elect their treatment, either with respect to the CIV as a whole or with respect to one or more classes of interests in the CIV, are free to modify the paragraph to do so.</p>
<p id="CO001-P006.28"><a href="#CO001-P006.28-R">(Added on 22 July 2010 see History)</a></p>
<p>6.29  Under either the approach in paragraphs <a href="#CO001-P006.21">6.21</a> and <a href="#CO001-P006.26">6.26</a> or in <a href="#CO001-P006.28">paragraph 6.28</a>, it will be necessary for the CIV to make a determination regarding the proportion of holders of interests who would have been entitled to benefits had they invested directly. Because ownership of interests in CIVs changes regularly, and such interests frequently are held through intermediaries, the CIV and its managers often do not themselves know the names and treaty status of the beneficial owners of interests. It would be impractical for the CIV to collect such information from the relevant intermediaries on a daily basis. Accordingly, Contracting States should be willing to accept practical and reliable approaches that do not require such daily tracing.</p>
<p id="CO001-P006.29"><a href="#CO001-P006.29-R">(Added on 22 July 2010 see History)</a></p>
<p>6.30  For example, in many countries the CIV industry is largely domestic, with an overwhelming percentage of investors resident in the country in which the CIV is established. In some cases, tax rules discourage foreign investment by imposing a withholding tax on distributions, or securities laws may severely restrict offerings to non-residents. Governments should consider whether these or other circumstances provide adequate protection against investment by non-treaty-eligible residents of third countries. It may be appropriate, for example, to assume that a CIV is owned by residents of the State in which it is established if the CIV has limited distribution of its shares or units to the State in which the CIV is established or to other States that provide for similar benefits in their treaties with the source State.</p>
<p id="CO001-P006.30"><a href="#CO001-P006.30-R">(Added on 22 July 2010 see History)</a></p>
<p>6.31  In other cases, interests in the CIV are offered to investors in many countries. Although the identity of individual investors will change daily, the proportion of investors in the CIV that are treaty-entitled is likely to change relatively slowly. Accordingly, it would be a reasonable approach to require the CIV to collect from other intermediaries, on specified dates, information enabling the CIV to determine the proportion of investors that are treaty-entitled. This information could be required at the end of a calendar or fiscal year or, if market conditions suggest that turnover in ownership is high, it could be required more frequently, although no more often than the end of each calendar quarter. The CIV could then make a claim on the basis of an average of those amounts over an agreed-upon time period. In adopting such procedures, care would have to be taken in choosing the measurement dates to ensure that the CIV would have enough time to update the information that it provides to other payers so that the correct amount is withheld at the beginning of each relevant period.</p>

<p>6.32  An alternative approach would provide that a CIV that is publicly traded in the Contracting State in which it is established will be entitled to treaty benefits without regard to the residence of its investors. This provision has been justified on the basis that a publicly-traded CIV cannot be used effectively for treaty shopping because the shareholders or unitholders of such a CIV cannot individually exercise control over it. Such a provision could read:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Convention, a collective investment vehicle which is established in a Contracting State and which receives income arising in the other Contracting State shall be treated for purposes of applying the Convention to such income as an individual who is a resident of the Contracting State in which it is established and as the beneficial owner of the income it receives (provided that, if an individual who is a resident of the first-mentioned State had received the income in the same circumstances, such individual would have been considered to be the beneficial owner thereof), if the principal class of shares or units in the collective investment vehicle is listed and regularly traded on a regulated stock exchange in that State.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this paragraph, the term “collective investment vehicle” means, in the case of [State A], a [  ] and, in the case of [State B], a [  ], as well as any other investment fund, arrangement or entity established in either Contracting State which the competent authorities of the Contracting States agree to regard as a collective investment vehicle for purposes of this paragraph.</p>

<p id="CO001-P006.32"><a href="#CO001-P006.32-R">(Added on 22 July 2010 see History)</a></p>
<p>6.33  Each of the provisions in paragraphs <a href="#CO001-P006.17">6.17</a>, <a href="#CO001-P006.21">6.21</a>, <a href="#CO001-P006.26">6.26</a> and <a href="#CO001-P006.32">6.32</a> treats the CIV as the resident and the beneficial owner of the income it receives for the purposes of the application of the Convention to such income, which has the simplicity of providing for one reduced rate of withholding with respect to each type of income. These provisions should not be construed, however, as restricting in any way the right of the State of source from taxing its own residents who are investors in the CIV. Clearly, these provisions are intended to deal with the source taxation of the CIV’s income and not the residence taxation of its investors (this conclusion is analogous to the one put forward in <a href="#CO001-P006.01">paragraph 6.1</a> above as regards partnerships). States that wish to confirm this point in the text of the provisions are free to amend the provisions accordingly, which could be done by adding the following sentence: “This provision shall not be construed as restricting in any way a Contracting State’s right to tax the residents of that State”.</p>

<p>6.34  Also, each of these provisions is intended only to provide that the specific characteristics of the CIV will not cause it to be treated as other than the beneficial owner of the income it receives. Therefore, a CIV will be treated as the beneficial owner of all of the income it receives. The provision is not intended, however, to put a CIV in a different or better position than other investors with respect to aspects of the beneficial ownership requirement that are unrelated to the CIV’s status as such. Accordingly, where an individual receiving an item of income in certain circumstances would not be considered as the beneficial owner of that income, a CIV receiving that income in the same circumstances could not be deemed to be the beneficial owner of the income. This result is confirmed by the parenthetical limiting the application of the provision to situations in which an individual in the same circumstances would have been treated as the beneficial owner of the income.</p>

<p>6.36  Issues may arise, however, in the case of entities set up and wholly-owned by a State or one of its political subdivisions or local authorities. Some of these entities may derive substantial income from other countries and it may therefore be important to determine whether tax treaties apply to them (this would be the case, for instance, of sovereign wealth funds: see <a href="#CO004-P008.05">paragraph 8.5</a> of the Commentary on Article 4). In many cases, these entities are totally exempt from tax and the question may arise as to whether they are entitled to the benefits of the tax treaties concluded by the State in which they are set up. In order to clarify the issue, some States modify the definition of “resident of a Contracting State” in <a href="#A004-P001">paragraph 1</a> of Article 4 and include in that definition a “statutory body”, an “agency or instrumentality” or a “legal person of public law” [<em>personne morale de droit public</em>] of a State, a political subdivision or local authority, which would therefore cover wholly-owned entities that are not considered to be a part of the State or its political subdivisions or local authorities.</p>

<p>6.37  In addition, many States include specific provisions in their bilateral conventions that grant an exemption to other States, and to some State-owned entities such as central banks, with respect to certain items of income such as interest (see <a href="#CO010-P013.02">paragraph 13.2</a> of the Commentary on Article 10 and <a href="#CO011-P007.04">paragraph 7.4</a> of the Commentary on Article 11). Treaty provisions that grant a tax exemption with respect to the income of pension funds (see <a href="#CO018-P069">paragraph 69</a> of the Commentary on Article 18) may similarly apply to pension funds that are wholly-owned by a State, depending on the wording of these provisions and the nature of the fund.</p>

<p>6.38  The application of the Convention to each Contracting State, its political subdivisions, and local authorities (and their statutory bodies, agencies or instrumentalities in the case of bilateral treaties that apply to such entities) should not be interpreted, however, as affecting in any way the possible application by each State of the customary international law principle of sovereign immunity. According to this principle, a sovereign State (including its agents, its property and activities) is, as a general rule, immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of another sovereign State. There is no international consensus, however, on the precise limits of the sovereign immunity principle. Most States, for example, would not recognise that the principle applies to business activities and many States do not recognise any application of this principle in tax matters. There are therefore considerable differences between States as regards the extent, if any, to which that principle applies to taxation. Even among States that would recognise its possible application in tax matters, some apply it only to the extent that it has been incorporated into domestic law and others apply it as customary international law but subject to important limitations. The Convention does not prejudge the issues of whether and to what extent the principle of sovereign immunity applies with respect to the persons covered under <a href="#A001">Article 1</a> and the taxes covered under <a href="#A002">Article 2</a> and each Contracting State is therefore free to apply its own interpretation of that principle as long as the resulting taxation, if any, is in conformity with the provisions of its bilateral tax conventions.</p>

<p>6.39  States often take account of various factors when considering whether and to what extent tax exemptions should be granted, through specific treaty or domestic law provisions or through the application of the sovereign immunity doctrine, with respect to the income derived by other States, their political subdivisions, local authorities, or their statutory bodies, agencies or instrumentalities. These factors would include, for example, whether that type of income would be exempt on a reciprocal basis, whether the income is derived from activities of a governmental nature as opposed to activities of a commercial nature, whether the assets and income of the recipient entity are used for public purposes, whether there is any possibility that these could inure to the benefit of a non-governmental person and whether the income is derived from a portfolio or direct investment.</p>

<p>7.  The principal purpose of double taxation conventions is to promote, by eliminating international double taxation, exchanges of goods and services, and the movement of capital and persons. It is also a purpose of tax conventions to prevent tax avoidance and evasion.</p>

<p>7.1  Taxpayers may be tempted to abuse the tax laws of a State by exploiting the differences between various countries’ laws. Such attempts may be countered by provisions or jurisprudential rules that are part of the domestic law of the State concerned. Such a State is then unlikely to agree to provisions of bilateral double taxation conventions that would have the effect of allowing abusive transactions that would otherwise be prevented by the provisions and rules of this kind contained in its domestic law. Also, it will not wish to apply its bilateral conventions in a way that would have that effect.</p>
<p id="CO001-P007.01"><a href="#CO001-P007.01-R">(Added on 28 January 2003 see History)</a></p>
<p>8.  It is also important to note that the extension of double taxation conventions increases the risk of abuse by facilitating the use of artificial legal constructions aimed at securing the benefits of both the tax advantages available under certain domestic laws and the reliefs from tax provided for in double taxation conventions.</p>
<p id="CO001-P008"><a href="#CO001-P008-R">(Replaced on 28 January 2003 see History)</a></p>
<p>9.  This would be the case, for example, if a person (whether or not a resident of a Contracting State), acts through a legal entity created in a State essentially to obtain treaty benefits that would not be available directly. Another case would be an individual who has in a Contracting State both his permanent home and all his economic interests, including a substantial shareholding in a company of that State, and who, essentially in order to sell the shares and escape taxation in that State on the capital gains from the alienation (by virtue of <a href="#A013-P005">paragraph 5</a> of Article 13), transfers his permanent home to the other Contracting State, where such gains are subject to little or no tax.</p>
<p id="CO001-P009"><a href="#CO001-P009-R">(Amended on 28 January 2003 see History)</a></p>
<p>9.1  This raises two fundamental questions that are discussed in the following paragraphs:<itemizedlist></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>whether the benefits of tax conventions must be granted when transactions that constitute an abuse of the provisions of these conventions are entered into (see paragraphs <a href="#CO001-P009.02">9.2</a> and following below); and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>whether specific provisions and jurisprudential rules of the domestic law of a Contracting State that are intended to prevent tax abuse conflict with tax conventions (see paragraphs <a href="#CO001-P022">22</a> and following below).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></itemizedlist></p>
<p id="CO001-P009.01"><a href="#CO001-P009.01-R">(Added on 28 January 2003 see History)</a></p>
<p>9.2  For many States, the answer to the first question is based on their answer to the second question. These States take account of the fact that taxes are ultimately imposed through the provisions of domestic law, as restricted (and in some rare cases, broadened) by the provisions of tax conventions. Thus, any abuse of the provisions of a tax convention could also be characterised as an abuse of the provisions of domestic law under which tax will be levied. For these States, the issue then becomes whether the provisions of tax conventions may prevent the application of the anti-abuse provisions of domestic law, which is the second question above. As indicated in <a href="#CO001-P022.01">paragraph 22.1</a> below, the answer to that second question is that to the extent these anti-avoidance rules are part of the basic domestic rules set by domestic tax laws for determining which facts give rise to a tax liability, they are not addressed in tax treaties and are therefore not affected by them. Thus, as a general rule, there will be no conflict between such rules and the provisions of tax conventions.</p>
<p id="CO001-P009.02"><a href="#CO001-P009.02-R">(Added on 28 January 2003 see History)</a></p>
<p>9.3  Other States prefer to view some abuses as being abuses of the convention itself, as opposed to abuses of domestic law. These States, however, then consider that a proper construction of tax conventions allows them to disregard abusive transactions, such as those entered into with the view to obtaining unintended benefits under the provisions of these conventions. This interpretation results from the object and purpose of tax conventions as well as the obligation to interpret them in good faith (see Article 31 of the <em>Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties</em>).</p>
<p id="CO001-P009.03"><a href="#CO001-P009.03-R">(Added on 28 January 2003 see History)</a></p>
<p>9.4  Under both approaches, therefore, it is agreed that States do not have to grant the benefits of a double taxation convention where arrangements that constitute an abuse of the provisions of the convention have been entered into.</p>
<p id="CO001-P009.04"><a href="#CO001-P009.04-R">(Added on 28 January 2003 see History)</a></p>
<p>9.5  It is important to note, however, that it should not be lightly assumed that a taxpayer is entering into the type of abusive transactions referred to above. A guiding principle is that the benefits of a double taxation convention should not be available where a main purpose for entering into certain transactions or arrangements was to secure a more favourable tax position and obtaining that more favourable treatment in these circumstances would be contrary to the object and purpose of the relevant provisions.</p>
<p id="CO001-P009.05"><a href="#CO001-P009.05-R">(Added on 28 January 2003 see History)</a></p>
<p>9.6  The potential application of general anti-abuse provisions does not mean that there is no need for the inclusion, in tax conventions, of specific provisions aimed at preventing particular forms of tax avoidance. Where specific avoidance techniques have been identified or where the use of such techniques is especially problematic, it will often be useful to add to the Convention provisions that focus directly on the relevant avoidance strategy. Also, this will be necessary where a State which adopts the view described in <a href="#CO001-P009.02">paragraph 9.2</a> above believes that its domestic law lacks the anti-avoidance rules or principles necessary to properly address such strategy.</p>
<p id="CO001-P009.06"><a href="#CO001-P009.06-R">(Added on 28 January 2003 see History)</a></p>
<p>10.  For instance, some forms of tax avoidance have already been expressly dealt with in the Convention, <em>e.g.</em> by the introduction of the concept of “beneficial owner” (in Articles <a href="#A010">10</a>, <a href="#A011">11</a>, and <a href="#A012">12</a>) and of special provisions such as <a href="#A017-P002">paragraph 2</a> of Article 17 dealing with so-called artiste-companies. Such problems are also mentioned in the Commentaries on Article 10 (paragraphs <a href="#CO010-P017">17</a> and <a href="#CO010-P022">22</a>), Article 11 (<a href="#CO011-P012">paragraph 12</a>) and Article 12 (<a href="#CO012-P007">paragraph 7</a>).</p>
<p id="CO001-P010"><a href="#CO001-P010-R">(Amended on 28 January 2003 see History)</a></p>
<p>10.1  Also, in some cases, claims to treaty benefits by subsidiary companies, in particular companies established in tax havens or benefiting from harmful preferential regimes, may be refused where careful consideration of the facts and circumstances of a case shows that the place of effective management of a subsidiary does not lie in its alleged state of residence but, rather, lies in the state of residence of the parent company so as to make it a resident of that latter state for domestic law and treaty purposes (this will be relevant where the domestic law of a state uses the place of management of a legal person, or a similar criterion, to determine its residence).</p>
<p id="CO001-P010.01"><a href="#CO001-P010.01-R">(Added on 28 January 2003 see History)</a></p>
<p>10.2  Careful consideration of the facts and circumstances of a case may also show that a subsidiary was managed in the state of residence of its parent in such a way that the subsidiary had a permanent establishment (<em>e.g.</em> by having a place of management) in that state to which all or a substantial part of its profits were properly attributable.</p>
<p id="CO001-P010.02"><a href="#CO001-P010.02-R">(Added on 28 January 2003 see History)</a></p>
<p>11.  A further example is provided by two particularly prevalent forms of improper use of the Convention which are discussed in two reports from the Committee on Fiscal Affairs entitled “<a href="#EMPTY">!!!! NEED TO LINK WITH REPORT !!!!</a>” and “<a href="#EMPTY">!!!! NEED TO LINK WITH REPORT !!!!</a>”.[^13] As indicated in these reports, the concern expressed in <a href="#CO001-P009">paragraph 9</a> above has proved to be valid as there has been a growing tendency toward the use of conduit companies to obtain treaty benefits not intended by the Contracting States in their bilateral negotiations. This has led an increasing number of member countries to implement treaty provisions (both general and specific) to counter abuse and to preserve anti-avoidance legislation in their domestic laws.</p>
<p id="CO001-P011"><a href="#CO001-P011-R">(Amended on 28 January 2003 see History)</a></p>
<p>12.  The treaty provisions that have been designed to cover these and other forms of abuse take different forms. The following are examples derived from provisions that have been incorporated in bilateral conventions concluded by member countries. These provide models that treaty negotiators might consider when searching for a solution to specific cases. In referring to them there should be taken into account:<itemizedlist></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the fact that these provisions are not mutually exclusive and that various provisions may be needed in order to address different concerns;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the degree to which tax advantages may actually be obtained by a particular avoidance strategy;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the legal context in both Contracting States and, in particular, the extent to which domestic law already provides an appropriate response to this avoidance strategy, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the extent to whichbona fideeconomic activities might be unintentionally disqualified by such provisions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></itemizedlist></p>
<p id="CO001-P012"><a href="#CO001-P012-R">(Amended on 28 January 2003 see History)</a></p>
<p id=""><title>Conduit company cases</title>13.  Many countries have attempted to deal with the issue of conduit companies and various approaches have been designed for that purpose. One solution would be to disallow treaty benefits to a company not owned, directly or indirectly, by residents of the State of which the company is a resident. For example, such a “look-through” provision might have the following wording:A company that is a resident of a Contracting State shall not be entitled to relief from taxation under this Convention with respect to any item of income, gains or profits if it is owned or controlled directly or through one or more companies, wherever resident, by persons who are not residents of a Contracting State.</p>
<p>Contracting States wishing to adopt such a provision may also want, in their bilateral negotiations, to determine the criteria according to which a company would be considered as owned or controlled by non-residents.</p>
<p id="CO001-P013"><a href="#CO001-P013-R">(Amended on 28 January 2003 see History)</a></p>
<p>14.  The “look-through approach” underlying the above provision seems an adequate basis for treaties with countries that have no or very low taxation and where little substantive business activities would normally be carried on. Even in these cases it might be necessary to alter the provision or to substitute for it another one to safeguardbona fidebusiness activities.</p>
<p id="CO001-P014"><a href="#CO001-P014-R">(Amended on 28 January 2003 see History)</a></p>
<p>15.  General subject-to-tax provisions provide that treaty benefits in the State of source are granted only if the income in question is subject to tax in the State of residence. This corresponds basically to the aim of tax treaties, namely to avoid double taxation. For a number of reasons, however, the Model Convention does not recommend such a general provision. Whilst this seems adequate with respect to a normal international relationship, a subject-to-tax approach might well be adopted in a typical conduit situation. A safeguarding provision of this kind could have the following wording:Where income arising in a Contracting State is received by a company resident of the other Contracting State and one or more persons not resident in that other Contracting State</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>have directly or indirectly or through one or more companies, wherever resident, a substantial interest in such company, in the form of a participation or otherwise, or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>exercise directly or indirectly, alone or together, the management or control of such company,</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>any provision of this Convention conferring an exemption from, or a reduction of, tax shall apply only to income that is subject to tax in the last-mentioned State under the ordinary rules of its tax law.The concept of “substantial interest” may be further specified when drafting a bilateral convention. Contracting States may express it, for instance, as a percentage of the capital or of the voting rights of the company.</p>
<p id="CO001-P015"><a href="#CO001-P015-R">(Renumbered on 28 January 2003 see History)</a></p>
<p>16.  The subject-to-tax approach seems to have certain merits. It may be used in the case of States with a well-developed economic structure and a complex tax law. It will, however, be necessary to supplement this provision by insertingbona fideprovisions in the treaty to provide for the necessary flexibility (see <a href="#CO001-P019">paragraph 19</a> below); moreover, such an approach does not offer adequate protection against advanced tax avoidance schemes such as “stepping-stone strategies”.</p>
<p id="CO001-P016"><a href="#CO001-P016-R">(Renumbered on 28 January 2003 see History)</a></p>
<p>17.  The approaches referred to above are in many ways unsatisfactory. They refer to the changing and complex tax laws of the Contracting States and not to the arrangements giving rise to the improper use of conventions. It has been suggested that the conduit problem be dealt with in a more straightforward way by inserting a provision that would single out cases of improper use with reference to the conduit arrangements themselves (the channel approach). Such a provision might have the following wording:Where income arising in a Contracting State is received by a company that is a resident of the other Contracting State and one or more persons who are not residents of that other Contracting State</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>have directly or indirectly or through one or more companies, wherever resident, a substantial interest in such company, in the form of a participation or otherwise, or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>exercise directly or indirectly, alone or together, the management or control of such company</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>any provision of this Convention conferring an exemption from, or a reduction of, tax shall not apply if more than 50 per cent of such income is used to satisfy claims by such persons (including interest, royalties, development, advertising, initial and travel expenses, and depreciation of any kind of business assets including those on immaterial goods and processes).</p>
<p id="CO001-P017"><a href="#CO001-P017-R">(Renumbered on 28 January 2003 see History)</a></p>
<p>18.  A provision of this kind appears to be the only effective way of combatting “stepping-stone” devices. It is found in bilateral treaties entered into by Switzerland and the United States and its principle also seems to underly the Swiss provisions against the improper use of tax treaties by certain types of Swiss companies. States that consider including a clause of this kind in their convention should bear in mind that it may cover normal business transactions and would therefore have to be supplemented by abona fideclause.</p>
<p id="CO001-P018"><a href="#CO001-P018-R">(Renumbered on 28 January 2003 see History)</a></p>
<p id="">19.  The solutions described above are of a general nature and they need to be accompanied by specific provisions to ensure that treaty benefits will be granted inbona fidecases. Such provisions could have the following wording:<title>General bona fide provision</title>“The foregoing provisions shall not apply where the company establishes that the principal purpose of the company, the conduct of its business and the acquisition or maintenance by it of the shareholding or other property from which the income in question is derived, are motivated by sound business reasons and do not have as primary purpose the obtaining of any benefits under this Convention.”</p>
<p>{: # }</p>
<p>{: # }</p>
<p id=""><title>Activity provision</title>“The foregoing provisions shall not apply where the company is engaged in substantive business operations in the Contracting State of which it is a resident and the relief from taxation claimed from the other Contracting State is with respect to income that is connected with such operations.”</p>
<p>{: # }</p>
<p>{: # }</p>
<p id=""><title>Amount of tax provision</title>“The foregoing provisions shall not apply where the reduction of tax claimed is not greater than the tax actually imposed by the Contracting State of which the company is a resident.”</p>
<p>{: # }</p>
<p>{: # }</p>
<p id=""><title>Stock exchange provision</title>“The foregoing provisions shall not apply to a company that is a resident of a Contracting State if the principal class of its shares is registered on an approved stock exchange in a Contracting State or if such company is wholly owned — directly or through one or more companies each of which is a resident of the first-mentioned State — by a company which is a resident of the first-mentioned State and the principal class of whose shares is so registered.”</p>
<p>{: # }</p>
<p>{: # }</p>
<p id=""><title>Alternative relief provision</title>In cases where an anti-abuse clause refers to non-residents of a Contracting State, it could be provided that the term “shall not be deemed to include residents of third States that have income tax conventions in force with the Contracting State from which relief from taxation is claimed and such conventions provide relief from taxation not less than the relief from taxation claimed under this Convention.”</p>
<p>{: # }</p>
<p>{: # }</p>
<p>These provisions illustrate possible approaches. The specific wording of the provisions to be included in a particular treaty depends on the general approach taken in that treaty and should be determined on a bilateral basis. Also, where the competent authorities of the Contracting States have the power to apply discretionary provisions, it may be considered appropriate to include an additional rule that would give the competent authority of the source country the discretion to allow the benefits of the Convention to a resident of the other State even if the resident fails to pass any of the tests described above.</p>

<p id="">20.  Whilst the preceding paragraphs identify different approaches to deal with conduit situations, each of them deals with a particular aspect of the problem commonly referred to as “treaty shopping”. States wishing to address the issue in a comprehensive way may want to consider the following example of detailed limitation-of-benefits provisions aimed at preventing persons who are not resident of either Contracting States from accessing the benefits of a Convention through the use of an entity that would otherwise qualify as a resident of one of these States, keeping in mind that adaptations may be necessary and that many States prefer other approaches to deal with treaty shopping:1.  Except as otherwise provided in this Article, a resident of a Contracting State who derives income from the other Contracting State shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Convention otherwise accorded to residents of a Contracting State only if such resident is a “qualified person” as defined in paragraph 2 and meets the other conditions of this Convention for the obtaining of such benefits.</p>
<p>2.  A resident of a Contracting State is a qualified person for a fiscal year only if such resident is either:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>an individual;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a qualified governmental entity;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a company, if</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>the principal class of its shares is listed on a recognised stock exchange specified in subparagraph <em>a)</em>or <em>b)</em> of paragraph 6 and is regularly traded on one or more recognised stock exchanges, or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>at least 50 per cent of the aggregate vote and value of the shares in the company is owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer companies entitled to benefits under subdivision (<em>i)</em> of this subparagraph, provided that, in the case of indirect ownership, each intermediate owner is a resident of either Contracting State;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>a charity or other tax-exempt entity, provided that, in the case of a pension trust or any other organization that is established exclusively to provide pension or other similar benefits, more than 50 per cent of the person’s beneficiaries, members or participants are individuals resident in either Contracting State; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a person other than an individual, if:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>on at least half the days of the fiscal year persons that are qualified persons by reason of subparagraph <em>a)</em>, <em>b)</em> or <em>d)</em> or subdivision <em>c)</em> (<em>i)</em> of this paragraph own, directly or indirectly, at least 50 per cent of the aggregate vote and value of the shares or other beneficial interests in the person, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>less than 50 per cent of the person’s gross income for the taxable year is paid or accrued, directly or indirectly, to persons who are not residents of either Contracting State in the form of payments that are deductible for purposes of the taxes covered by this Convention in the person’s State of residence (but not including arm’s length payments in the ordinary course of business for services or tangible property and payments in respect of financial obligations to a bank, provided that where such a bank is not a resident of a Contracting State such payment is attributable to a permanent establishment of that bank located in one of the Contracting States).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>3.  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A resident of a Contracting State will be entitled to benefits of the Convention with respect to an item of income, derived from the other State, regardless of whether the resident is a qualified person, if the resident is actively carrying on business in the first-mentioned State (other than the business of making or managing investments for the resident’s own account, unless these activities are banking, insurance or securities activities carried on by a bank, insurance company or registered securities dealer), the income derived from the other Contracting State is derived in connection with, or is incidental to, that business and that resident satisfies the other conditions of this Convention for the obtaining of such benefits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the resident or any of its associated enterprises carries on a business activity in the other Contracting State which gives rise to an item of income, subparagraph <em>a)</em> shall apply to such item only if the business activity in the first-mentioned State is substantial in relation to business carried on in the other State. Whether a business activity is substantial for purposes of this paragraph will be determined based on all the facts and circumstances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In determining whether a person is actively carrying on business in a Contracting State under subparagraph <em>a)</em>, activities conducted by a partnership in which that person is a partner and activities conducted by persons connected to such person shall be deemed to be conducted by such person. A person shall be connected to another if one possesses at least 50 per cent of the beneficial interest in the other (or, in the case of a company, at least 50 per cent of the aggregate vote and value of the company’s shares) or another person possesses, directly or indirectly, at least 50 per cent of the beneficial interest (or, in the case of a company, at least 50 per cent of the aggregate vote and value of the company’s shares) in each person. In any case, a person shall be considered to be connected to another if, based on all the facts and circumstances, one has control of the other or both are under the control of the same person or persons.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>4.  Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, if a company that is a resident of a Contracting State, or a company that controls such a company, has outstanding a class of shares</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>which is subject to terms or other arrangements which entitle its holders to a portion of the income of the company derived from the other Contracting State that is larger than the portion such holders would receive absent such terms or arrangements (“the disproportionate part of the income”); and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>50 per cent or more of the voting power and value of which is owned by persons who are not qualified persons</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p id="">the benefits of this Convention shall not apply to the disproportionate part of the income.5.  A resident of a Contracting State that is neither a qualified person pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 2 or entitled to benefits under paragraph 3 or 4 shall, nevertheless, be granted benefits of the Convention if the competent authority of that other Contracting State determines that the establishment, acquisition or maintenance of such person and the conduct of its operations did not have as one of its principal purposes the obtaining of benefits under the Convention.</p>
<p>6.  For the purposes of this Article the term “recognised stock exchange” means:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>in State A ……..;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in State B ……..; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>any other stock exchange which the competent authorities agree to recognise for the purposes of this Article.</p>

<p id=""><title>Provisions which are aimed at entities benefiting from preferential tax regimes</title>21.  Specific types of companies enjoying tax privileges in their State of residence facilitate conduit arrangements and raise the issue of harmful tax practices. Where tax-exempt (or nearly tax-exempt) companies may be distinguished by special legal characteristics, the improper use of tax treaties may be avoided by denying the tax treaty benefits to these companies (the exclusion approach). As such privileges are granted mostly to specific types of companies as defined in the commercial law or in the tax law of a country, the most radical solution would be to exclude such companies from the scope of the treaty. Another solution would be to insert a safeguarding clause which would apply to the income received or paid by such companies and which could be drafted along the following lines:No provision of the Convention conferring an exemption from, or reduction of, tax shall apply to income received or paid by a company as defined under section ... of the ... Act, or under any similar provision enacted by ... after the signature of the Convention.</p>
<p>The scope of this provision could be limited by referring only to specific types of income, such as dividends, interest, capital gains, or directors’ fees. Under such provisions companies of the type concerned would remain entitled to the protection offered under <a href="#A024">Article 24</a> (Non-Discrimination) and to the benefits of <a href="#A025">Article 25</a> (Mutual Agreement Procedure) and they would be subject to the provisions of <a href="#A026">Article 26</a> (Exchange of Information).</p>

<p>21.1  Exclusion provisions are clear and their application is simple, even though they may require administrative assistance in some instances. They are an important instrument by which a State that has created special privileges in its tax law may prevent those privileges from being used in connection with the improper use of tax treaties concluded by that State.</p>

The following provision aims at denying the benefits of the Convention to entities which would otherwise qualify as residents of a Contracting State but which enjoy, in that State, a preferential tax regime restricted to foreign-held entities (i.e.not available to entities that belong to residents of that State):Any company, trust or partnership that is a resident of a Contracting State and is beneficially owned or controlled directly or indirectly by one or more persons who are not residents of that State shall not be entitled to the benefits of this Convention if the amount of the tax imposed on the income or capital of the company, trust or partnership by that State (after taking into account any reduction or offset of the amount of tax in any manner, including a refund, reimbursement, contribution, credit or allowance to the company, trust or partnership, or to any other person) is substantially lower than the amount that would be imposed by that State if all of the shares of the capital stock of the company or all of the interests in the trust or partnership, as the case may be, were beneficially owned by one or more residents of that State.</p>

<p><title>Provisions which are aimed at particular types of income</title>21.3  The following provision aims at denying the benefits of the Convention with respect to income that is subject to low or no tax under a preferential tax regime:1.  The benefits of this Convention shall not apply to income which may, in accordance with the other provisions of the Convention, be taxed in a Contracting State and which is derived from activities the performance of which do not require substantial presence in that State, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>such activities involving banking, shipping, financing, insurance or electronic commerce activities; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>activities involving headquarter or coordination centre or similar arrangements providing company or group administration, financing or other support; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>activities which give rise to passive income, such as dividends, interest and royalties</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>where, under the laws or administrative practices of that State, such income is preferentially taxed and, in relation thereto, information is accorded confidential treatment that prevents the effective exchange of information.2.  For the purposes of paragraph 1, income is preferentially taxed in a Contracting State if, other than by reason of the preceding Articles of this Agreement, an item of income:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>is exempt from tax; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is taxable in the hands of a taxpayer but that is subject to a rate of tax that is lower than the rate applicable to an equivalent item that is taxable in the hands of similar taxpayers who are residents of that State; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>benefits from a credit, rebate or other concession or benefit that is provided directly or indirectly in relation to that item of income, other than a credit for foreign tax paid.</p>

<p>22.  Other forms of abuse of tax treaties (<em>e.g.</em> the use of a base company) and possible ways to deal with them, including “substance-over-form”, “economic substance” and general anti-abuse rules have also been analysed, particularly as concerns the question of whether these rules conflict with tax treaties, which is the second question mentioned in <a href="#CO001-P009.01">paragraph 9.1</a> above.</p>
<p id="CO001-P022"><a href="#CO001-P022-R">(Amended on 28 January 2003 see History)</a></p>
<p>22.1  Such rules are part of the basic domestic rules set by domestic tax laws for determining which facts give rise to a tax liability; these rules are not addressed in tax treaties and are therefore not affected by them. Thus, as a general rule and having regard to <a href="#CO001-P009.05">paragraph 9.5</a>, there will be no conflict. For example, to the extent that the application of the rules referred to in <a href="#CO001-P022">paragraph 22</a> results in a recharacterisation of income or in a redetermination of the taxpayer who is considered to derive such income, the provisions of the Convention will be applied taking into account these changes.</p>

<p>23.  The use of base companies may also be addressed through controlled foreign companies provisions. A significant number of member and non-member countries have now adopted such legislation. Whilst the design of this type of legislation varies considerably among countries, a common feature of these rules, which are now internationally recognised as a legitimate instrument to protect the domestic tax base, is that they result in a Contracting State taxing its residents on income attributable to their participation in certain foreign entities. It has sometimes been argued, based on a certain interpretation of provisions of the Convention such as <a href="#A007-P001">paragraph 1</a> of Article 7 and <a href="#A010-P005">paragraph 5</a> of Article 10, that this common feature of controlled foreign companies legislation conflicted with these provisions. For the reasons explained in paragraphs <a href="#CO007-P014">14</a> of the Commentary on Article 7 and <a href="#CO010-P037">37</a> of the Commentary on Article 10, that interpretation does not accord with the text of the provisions. It also does not hold when these provisions are read in their context. Thus, whilst some countries have felt it useful to expressly clarify, in their conventions, that controlled foreign companies legislation did not conflict with the Convention, such clarification is not necessary. It is recognised that controlled foreign companies legislation structured in this way is not contrary to the provisions of the Convention.</p>

<p>26.  States that adopt controlled foreign companies provisions or the anti-abuse rules referred to above in their domestic tax laws seek to maintain the equity and neutrality of these laws in an international environment characterised by very different tax burdens, but such measures should be used only for this purpose. As a general rule, these measures should not be applied where the relevant income has been subjected to taxation that is comparable to that in the country of residence of the taxpayer.</p>

<h2 id="remittance-based-taxation">Remittance based taxation<a class="headerlink" href="#remittance-based-taxation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p id="">26.1  Under the domestic law of some States, persons who qualify as residents but who do not have what is considered to be a permanent link with the State (sometimes referred to as domicile) are only taxed on income derived from sources outside the State to the extent that this income is effectively repatriated, or remitted, thereto. Such persons are not, therefore, subject to potential double taxation to the extent that foreign income is not remitted to their State of residence and it may be considered inappropriate to give them the benefit of the provisions of the Convention on such income. Contracting States which agree to restrict the application of the provisions of the Convention to income that is effectively taxed in the hands of these persons may do so by adding the following provision to the Convention:Where under any provision of this Convention income arising in a Contracting State is relieved in whole or in part from tax in that State and under the law in force in the other Contracting State a person, in respect of the said income, is subject to tax by reference to the amount thereof which is remitted to or received in that other State and not by reference to the full amount thereof, then any relief provided by the provisions of this Convention shall apply only to so much of the income as is taxed in the other Contracting State.</p>
<p>In some States, the application of that provision could create administrative difficulties if a substantial amount of time elapsed between the time the income arose in a Contracting State and the time it were taxed by the other Contracting State in the hands of a resident of that other State. States concerned by these difficulties could subject the rule in the last part of the above provision,i.e.that the income in question will be entitled to benefits in the first-mentioned State only when taxed in the other State, to the condition that the income must be so taxed in that other State within a specified period of time from the time the income arises in the first-mentioned State.</p>

<p>26.2  A number of Articles of the Convention limit the right of a State to tax income derived from its territory. As noted in <a href="#CO010-P019">paragraph 19</a> of the Commentary on Article 10 as concerns the taxation of dividends, the Convention does not settle procedural questions and each State is free to use the procedure provided in its domestic law in order to apply the limits provided by the Convention. A State can therefore automatically limit the tax that it levies in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Convention, subject to possible prior verification of treaty entitlement, or it can impose the tax provided for under its domestic law and subsequently refund the part of that tax that exceeds the amount that it can levy under the provisions of the Convention. As a general rule, in order to ensure expeditious implementation of taxpayers’ benefits under a treaty, the first approach is the highly preferable method. If a refund system is needed, it should be based on observable difficulties in identifying entitlement to treaty benefits. Also, where the second approach is adopted, it is extremely important that the refund be made expeditiously, especially if no interest is paid on the amount of the refund, as any undue delay in making that refund is a direct cost to the taxpayer.</p>

This is the case, for example, of the treatment of the situation of partners of partnerships — a concept which is considerably fluid given the differences between States — that are fiscally transparent, including the situation where a third State is inserted between the State of source and the State of residence of the partners. The administrative difficulties resulting from some of the solutions put forward should also be noted, as indicated in the report itself in certain cases.</p>

<p>27.4  <em>Belgium</em> cannot share the views expressed in <a href="#CO001-P023">paragraph 23</a> of the Commentary. Belgium considers that the application of controlled foreign companies legislation is contrary to the provisions of <a href="#A005-P007">paragraph 7</a> of Article 5, <a href="#A007-P001">paragraph 1</a> of Article 7 and <a href="#A010-P005">paragraph 5</a> of Article 10 of the Convention. This is especially the case where a Contracting State taxes one of its residents on income derived by a foreign entity by using a fiction attributing to that resident, in proportion to his participation in the capital of the foreign entity, the income derived by that entity. By doing so, that State increases the tax base of its resident by including in it income which has not been derived by that resident but by a foreign entity which is not taxable in that State in accordance with the Convention. That Contracting State thus disregards the legal personality of the foreign entity and therefore acts contrary to the Convention (see also <a href="#CO007-P079">paragraph 79</a> of the Commentary on Article 7 and <a href="#CO010-P068.01">paragraph 68.1</a> of the Commentary on Article 10).</p>

<p>27.5  Concerning potential conflicts between anti-abuse provisions (including controlled foreign company — CFC — provisions) in domestic law and the provisions of tax treaties, <em>Ireland</em> considers that it is not possible to have a simple general conclusion that no conflict will exist or that any conflict must be resolved in favour of the domestic law. This will depend on the nature of the domestic law provision and also on the legal and constitutional relationship in individual member countries between domestic law and international agreements and law. Also, Ireland does not agree with the deletion of the language in <a href="#CO001-P026">paragraph 26</a> (as it read until 2002), which stated: “It would be contrary to the general principles underlying the Model Convention and to the spirit of tax treaties in general if counteracting measures were to be extended to activities such as production, normal rendering of services or trading of companies engaged in real industrial or commercial activity, when they are clearly related to the economic environment of the country where they are resident in a situation where these activities are carried out in such a way that no tax avoidance could be suspected”.</p>

<p>27.7  The <em>Netherlands</em> does not adhere to the statements in the Commentaries that as a general rule domestic anti-avoidance rules and controlled foreign companies provisions do not conflict with the provisions of tax conventions. The compatibility of such rules and provisions with tax treaties is, among other things, dependent on the nature and wording of the specific provision, the wording and purpose of the relevant treaty provision and the relationship between domestic and international law in a country. Since tax conventions are not meant to facilitate the improper use thereof, the application of national rules and provisions may be justified in specific cases of abuse or clearly unintended use. In such situations the application of domestic measures has to respect the principle of proportionality and should not go beyond what is necessary to prevent the abuse or the clearly unintended use.</p>

<p id=""><strong><a href="#CO001-P001">Paragraph 1</a></strong>: Amended on 21 September 1995 when a number of minor drafting changes that did not affect the meaning of the text were made to the Commentary on Article 1. In the 1977 Model Convention and until 21 September 1995, paragraph 1 read as follows:“1.  Whereas the earliest conventions in general were applicable to “citizens” of the Contracting States, more recent conventions usually apply to “residents” of one or both of the Contracting States irrespective of nationality. Some conventions are of even wider scope inasmuch they apply more generally to “taxpayers” of the Contracting States; they are, therefore, also applicable to persons, who, although not residing in either State, are nevertheless liable to tax on part of their income or capital in each of them. The Convention is intended to be applied between OECD Member countries and it has been deemed preferable for practical reasons to provide that the Convention is to apply to persons who are residents of one or both of the Contracting States. The term “resident” is defined in Article 4.”</p>
<p id="">Paragraph 1 was previously amended when the 1977 Model Convention was adopted by the OECD Council on 11 April 1977. In the 1963 Draft Convention (adopted by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963) and until the adoption of the 1977 Model Convention, paragraph 1 read as follows:“1.  Whereas older Conventions in general were applicable to “citizens” of the Contracting States, recent Conventions usually apply to “residents” of one or both of the Contracting States, without distinction of nationality. Some Conventions are of even wider scope inasmuch as they apply more generally to “taxpayers” of the Contracting States; they are, therefore, also applicable to persons, who, although not residing in either State, are nevertheless liable to tax on part of their income or capital in each of them. The Convention is intended to be applied between Member countries of the O.E.C.D. and it has been deemed preferable for practical reasons to provide that the Convention is to apply to persons who are residents of one or both of the Contracting States.

In the 1977 Model Convention and until 29 April 2000, paragraph 2 read as follows:“2.  The domestic laws of the various OECD Member countries differ in the treatment of partnerships. The main issue of such differences is founded on the fact that some countries treat partnerships as taxable units (sometimes even as companies) whereas other countries disregard the partnership and tax only the individual partners on their shares of the partnership income.”</p>

These differences in views have many effects on the application of the Convention in the case of partnerships, especially where one or more partners are not residents of the State in which the partnership was created or organised. First, the question arises whether a partnership as such may invoke the provisions of the Convention. Where a partnership is treated as a company or taxed in the same way, it may reasonably be argued that the partnership is a resident of the Contracting State taxing the partnership on the grounds mentioned in paragraph 1 of Article 4 and therefore, falling under the scope of the Convention, is entitled to the benefits of the Convention. In the other instances mentioned in paragraph 2 above, the application of the Convention to the partnership as such might be refused, at least if no special rule covering partnerships is provided for in the Convention.”</p>

In the 1977 Model Convention and until 29 April 2000, paragraph 4 read as follows:“4.  Moreover, different rules of the Convention may be applied in the Contracting States to income derived by a partner from the partnership, depending on the approach of such States. In States where partnerships are treated as companies, distributions of profits to the partners may be considered to be dividends (paragraph 3 of Article 10), whilst for other States all profits of a partnership, whether distributed or not, are considered as business profits of the partners (Article 7). In many States, business profits of partnerships include, for tax purposes, all or some special remuneration paid by a partnership to its partners (such as rents, interest, royalties, remuneration for services), whilst in other States such payments are not dealt with as business profits (Article 7) but under other headings (in the above-mentioned examples: Articles 6, 11, 12, 14 and 15, respectively).”</p>

<p id=""><strong><a href="#CO001-P005">Paragraph 5</a></strong>: Amended on 17 July 2008, by replacing the cross-reference to “paragraph 8.4 of the Commentary on Article 4” by “paragraph 8.7 of the Commentary on Article 4”, by the report entitled “The 2008 Update to the Model Tax Convention”, adopted by the OECD Council on 17 July 2008. After 29 April 2000 and until 17 July 2008, paragraph 5 read as follows:“5.  Where a partnership is treated as a company or taxed in the same way, it is a resident of the Contracting State that taxes the partnership on the grounds mentioned in paragraph 1 of Article 4 and, therefore, it is entitled to the benefits of the Convention. Where, however, a partnership is treated as fiscally transparent in a State, the partnership is not “liable to tax” in that State within the meaning of paragraph 1 of Article 4, and so cannot be a resident thereof for purposes of the Convention. In such a case, the application of the Convention to the partnership as such would be refused, unless a special rule covering partnerships were provided for in the Convention. Where the application of the Convention is so refused, the partners should be entitled, with respect to their share of the income of the partnership, to the benefits provided by the Conventions entered into by the States of which they are residents to the extent that the partnership’s income is allocated to them for the purposes of taxation in their State of residence (see paragraph 8.4 of the Commentary on Article 4).”</p>
<p id="">Paragraph 5 was replaced on 29 April 2000 when it was deleted and a new paragraph 5 was added by the report entitled “The 2000 Update to the Model Tax Convention”, adopted by the OECD Committee on Fiscal Affairs on 29 April 2000 on the basis of Annex I of another report entitled “The Application of the OECD Model Convention to Partnerships” (adopted by the OECD Committee on Fiscal Affairs on 20 January 1999). The new paragraph 5 incorporated, with amendments, the second sentence of paragraph 3 of the 1977 Model Convention (see history of paragraph 3). In the 1977 Model Convention and until 29 April 2000, paragraph 5 read as follows:“5.  Finally the capital invested in a partnership or the alienation of a participation in a partnership may be treated, depending on the approach, under paragraph 2 of Articles 22 and 13 (permanent establishment) or paragraph 4 of Articles 22 and 13 (other movable property).”</p>

<p id=""><strong><a href="#CO001-P006">Paragraph 6</a></strong>: Replaced on 29 April 2000 when paragraph 6 was deleted and a new paragraph 6 was added by the report entitled “The 2000 Update to the Model Tax Convention”, adopted by the OECD Committee on Fiscal Affairs on 29 April 2000 on the basis of Annex I of another report entitled “The Application of the OECD Model Convention to Partnerships” (adopted by the OECD Committee on Fiscal Affairs on 20 January 1999). After 23 July 1992 and until 29 April 2000, paragraph 6 read as follows:“6.  The concurrent application of different Articles of the Convention in the two Contracting States (or even the non-application of the Convention in one of them) may result not only in double taxation, but also in non-taxation. However the practical application of double taxation conventions, whether or not based on the Model Convention, and discussions in the Committee on Fiscal Affairs when the 1977 Model Convention was being drafted have shown that the opinions of the OECD Member countries differ too much and that it is extremely difficult to find a uniform solution that would be acceptable to all or even to the great majority of Member countries. The Convention does not, therefore, contain any special provisions relating to partnerships. Contracting States are however left free to examine the problems of partnerships in their bilateral negotiations and to agree upon such special provisions as they may find necessary and appropriate.”</p>
<p id="">Paragraph 6 was amended on 23 July 1992 by the report entitled “The Revision of the Model Convention”, adopted by the OECD Council on 23 July 1992. In the 1977 Model Convention and until 23 July 1992, paragraph 6 read as follows:“6.  The concurrent application of different Articles of the Convention in the two Contracting States (or even the non-application of the Convention in one of them) may not only result in double taxation, but also in non-taxation. However the practical application of double taxation conventions, whether or not based on the 1963 Draft Convention, and the discussions on the revision of the 1963 Draft Convention have shown that the opinions of the OECD Member countries differ too much and that it is extremely difficult to find a uniform solution which would be acceptable to all or even to the great majority of Member countries. The Convention does not, therefore, contain any special provisions relating to partnerships.

In the 1977 Model Convention and until 28 January 2003, paragraph 10 read as follows:“10.  Some of these situations are dealt with in the Convention, <em>e.g.</em> by the introduction of the concept of “beneficial owner” (in Articles 10, 11 and 12) and of special provisions, for so-called artiste-companies (paragraph 2 of Article 17). Such problems are also mentioned in the Commentaries on Article 10 (paragraphs 17 and 22), Article 11 (paragraph 12), and Article 12 (paragraph 7). It may be appropriate for Contracting States to agree in bilateral negotiations that any relief from tax should not apply in certain cases, or to agree that the application of the provisions of domestic laws against tax avoidance should not be affected by the Convention.”</p>

Improper uses of the Convention are discussed in two reports from the Committee on Fiscal Affairs entitled “Double Taxation Conventions and the Use of Base Companies” and “Double Taxation Conventions and the Use of Conduit Companies”. As indicated in these reports, the concern expressed in paragraph 9 above has proved to be valid as there has been a growing tendency toward the use of conduit companies to obtain treaty benefits not intended by the Contracting States in their bilateral negotiations. This has led an increasing number of Member countries to implement treaty provisions (both general and specific) to counter abuse and to preserve anti-avoidance legislation in their domestic laws.”</p>

After 23 July 1992 and until 21 September 1995, paragraph 21 read as follows:“21.  The solutions described above are of a general nature and they need to be accompanied by specific provisions to ensure that treaty benefits will be granted inbona fidecases. Such provisions could have the following wording:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>General</em>bona fide<em>provision</em></li>
</ol>
<p id="">“The foregoing provisions shall not apply where the company establishes that the principal purpose of the company, the conduct of its business and the acquisition or maintenance by it of the shareholding or other property from which the income in question is derived, are motivated by sound business reasons and do not have as primary purpose the obtaining of any benefits under this Convention.”</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Activity provision</em></li>
</ol>
<p id="">“The foregoing provisions shall not apply where the company is engaged in substantive business operations in the Contracting State of which it is a resident and the relief from taxation claimed from the other Contracting State is with respect to income that is connected with such operations.”</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Amount of tax provision</em></li>
</ol>
<p id="">“The foregoing provisions shall not apply where the reduction of tax claimed is not greater than the tax actually imposed by the Contracting State of which the company is a resident.”</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Stock exchange provision</em></li>
</ol>
<p id="">“The foregoing provisions shall not apply to a company that is a resident of a Contracting State if the principal class of its shares is registered on an approved stock exchange in a Contracting State or if such company is wholly owned — directly or through one or more companies each of which is a resident of the first-mentioned State — by a company which is a resident of the first-mentioned State and the principal class of whose shares is so registered.”</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Alternative relief provision</em></li>
</ol>
<p id="">“In cases where an anti-abuse clause refers to non-residents of a Contracting State, it could be provided that the term “shall not be deemed to include residents of third States that have income tax conventions in force with the Contracting State from which relief from taxation is claimed and such conventions provide relief from taxation not less than the relief from taxation claimed under this Convention”.”</p>
<p>These provisions illustrate possible approaches. The specific wording of the provisions to be included in a particular treaty depends on the general approach taken in that treaty and should be determined on a bilateral basis. Also, where the competent authorities of the Contracting States have the power to apply discretionary provisions, it may be considered appropriate to include an additional rule that would give the competent authority of the source country the discretion to allow the benefits of the Convention to a resident of the other State even if the resident fails to pass any of the tests described above.”</p>

The improper use of tax treaties may then be avoided by denying the tax treaty benefits to these companies (the exclusion approach). The main cases are specific types of companies enjoying tax privileges in their State of residence giving them in fact a status similar to that of a non-resident. As such privileges are granted mostly to specific types of companies as defined in the commercial law or in the tax law of a country, the most radical solution would be to exclude such companies from the scope of the treaty. Another solution would be to insert a safeguarding clause such as the following:“No provision of the Convention conferring an exemption from, or reduction of, tax shall apply to income received or paid by a company as defined under Section ... of the ...

After 23 July 1992 and until 28 January 2003, paragraph 22 read as follows:“22.  Other forms of abuse of tax treaties (<em>e.g.</em> the use of a base company) and of possible ways to deal with them such as “substance-over-form” rules and “sub-part F type” provisions have also been analysed.”</p>

On that date paragraph 25 was amended and renumbered as paragraph 22.2 by the report entitled the “2002 Update to the Model Tax Convention” adopted by the OECD Council on 28 January 2003. After 21 September 1995 and until 28 January 2003, paragraph 25 read as follows:“25.  While these and the other counteracting measures described in the reports mentioned in paragraph 11 above are not inconsistent with the spirit of tax treaties, there is agreement that member countries should carefully observe the specific obligations enshrined in tax treaties, as long as there is no clear evidence that the treaties are being improperly used. Furthermore, it seems desirable that counteracting measures comply with the spirit of tax treaties with a view to avoiding double taxation. Where the taxpayer complies with such counteracting measures, it might furthermore be appropriate to grant him the protection of the treaty network.”</p>
<p>Paragraph 25 was previously amended on 21 September 1995, by replacing the words “it might be adequate to grant him” with “it might be appropriate to grant him” in the last sentence, when a number of minor drafting changes that did not affect the meaning of the text were made to the Commentary on Article 1.</p>
<p>Paragraph 25 was added on 23 July 1992 by the report entitled “The Revision of the Model Convention”, adopted by the OECD Council on 23 July 1992, on the basis of paragraph 46 of a previous report entitled “Double Taxation Conventions and the Use of Base Companies” (adopted by the Council of the OECD on 27 November 1986).</p>

After 17 July 2008 and until 22 July 2010, paragraph 23 read as follows:“23.  The use of base companies may also be addressed through controlled foreign companies provisions. A significant number of Member and non-member countries have now adopted such legislation. Whilst the design of this type of legislation varies considerably among countries, a common feature of these rules, which are now internationally recognised as a legitimate instrument to protect the domestic tax base, is that they result in a Contracting State taxing its residents on income attributable to their participation in certain foreign entities. It has sometimes been argued, based on a certain interpretation of provisions of the Convention such as paragraph 1 of Article 7 and paragraph 5 of Article 10, that this common feature of controlled foreign companies legislation conflicted with these provisions. For the reasons explained in paragraphs 13 of the Commentary on Article 7 and 37 of the Commentary on Article 10, that interpretation does not accord with the text of the provisions. It also does not hold when these provisions are read in their context. Thus, whilst some countries have felt it useful to expressly clarify, in their conventions, that controlled foreign companies legislation did not conflict with the Convention, such clarification is not necessary. It is recognised that controlled foreign companies legislation structured in this way is not contrary to the provisions of the Convention.”</p>

After 21 September 1995 and until 28 January 2003, paragraph 23 read as follows:“23.  The large majority of OECD member countries consider that such measures are part of the basic domestic rules set by national tax law for determining which facts give rise to a tax liability. These rules are not addressed in tax treaties and are therefore not affected by them. One could invoke the spirit of the Convention, which would be violated only if a company, which is a person within the meaning of the Convention, ended up with no or almost no activity or income being attributed to it, and the Contracting States took divergent views on the subject, with economic double taxation resulting therefrom, the same income being taxed twice in the hands of two different taxpayers (see paragraph 2 of Article 9). A dissenting view, on the other hand, holds that such rules are subject to the general provisions of tax treaties against double taxation, especially where the treaty itself contains provisions aimed at counteracting its improper use.”</p>
<p id="">Paragraph 23 was amended on 21 September 1995, by replacing the words “almost no activity and/or income” with “almost no activity or income” in the third sentence, on 21 September 1995 when a number of minor drafting changes that did not affect the meaning of the text were made to the Commentary on Article 1. After 23 July 1992 and until 21 September 1995, paragraph 23 read as follows:“23.

After 21 September 1995 and until 28 January 2003, paragraph 24 read as follows:“24.  It is not easy to reconcile these divergent opinions, either in theory or in mutual agreement procedures on specific cases. The main problem seems to be whether or not general principles such as “substance-over-form” are inherent in treaty provisions,i.e.whether they can be applied in any case, or only to the extent they are expressly mentioned in bilateral conventions. The dissenting view argues that to give domestic rules precedence over treaty rules as to who, for tax purposes, is regarded as the recipient of the income shifted to a base company, would erode the protection of taxpayers against double taxation (<em>e.g.</em> where by applying these rules, base company income is taxed in the country of the shareholders even though there is no permanent establishment of the base company there). However, it is the view of the wide majority that such rules, and the underlying principles, do not have to be confirmed in the text of the convention to be applicable.”</p>

After 21 September 1995 and until 28 January 2003, paragraph 26 read as follows:“26.  The majority of member countries accept counteracting measures as a necessary means of maintaining equity and neutrality of national tax laws in an international environment characterised by very different tax burdens, but believe that such measures should be used only for this purpose. It would be contrary to the general principles underlying the Model Convention and to the spirit of tax treaties in general if counteracting measures were to be extended to activities such as production, normal rendering of services or trading of companies engaged in real industrial or commercial activity, when they are clearly related to the economic environment of the country where they are resident in a situation where these activities are carried out in such a way that no tax avoidance could be suspected. Counteracting measures should not be applied to countries in which taxation is comparable to that of the country of residence of the taxpayer.”</p>
<p id="">Paragraph 26 was amended on 21 September 1995, by replacing the words “but such measures” with “but believe that such measures” in the first sentence, when a number of minor drafting changes that did not affect the meaning of the text were made to the Commentary on Article 1.

This is especially the case where a Contracting State taxes one of its residents on income derived by a foreign entity by using a fiction attributing to that resident, in proportion to his participation in the capital of the foreign entity, the income derived by that entity. By doing so, that State increases the tax base of its resident by including in it income which has not been derived by that resident but by a foreign entity which is not taxable in that State in accordance with the Convention.
