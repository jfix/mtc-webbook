<h1 id="concerning-the-taxation-of-income-from-immovable-property">CONCERNING THE TAXATION OF INCOME FROM IMMOVABLE PROPERTY<a class="headerlink" href="#concerning-the-taxation-of-income-from-immovable-property" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>1.  Paragraph <a href="#A006-P001">1</a> gives the right to tax income from immovable property to the State of source, that is, the State in which the property producing such income is situated. This is due to the fact that there is always a very close economic connection between the source of this income and the State of source. Although income from agriculture or forestry is included in <a href="#A006">Article 6</a>, Contracting States are free to agree in their bilateral conventions to treat such income under <a href="#A007">Article 7</a>. <a href="#A006">Article 6</a> deals only with income which a resident of a Contracting State derives from immovable property situated in the other Contracting State. It does not, therefore, apply to income from immovable property situated in the Contracting State of which the recipient is a resident within the meaning of <a href="#A004">Article 4</a> or situated in a third State; the provisions of <a href="#A021-P001">paragraph 1</a> of Article 21 shall apply to such income.</p>
<p id="CO006-P001"><a href="#CO006-P001-R">(Amended on 11 April 1977 see History)</a></p>
<p>2.  Defining the concept of immovable property by reference to the law of the State in which the property is situated, as is provided in <a href="#A006-P002">paragraph 2</a>, will help to avoid difficulties of interpretation over the question whether an asset or a right is to be regarded as immovable property or not. The paragraph, however, specifically mentions the assets and rights which must always be regarded as immovable property. In fact such assets and rights are already treated as immovable property according to the laws or the taxation rules of most OECD member countries. Conversely, the paragraph stipulates that ships, boats and aircraft shall never be considered as immovable property. No special provision has been included as regards income from indebtedness secured by immovable property, as this question is settled by <a href="#A011">Article 11</a>.</p>
<p id="CO006-P002"><a href="#CO006-P002-R">(Amended on 11 April 1977 see History)</a></p>
<p>2.1  The phrase “including income from agriculture or forestry” in <a href="#A006-P001">paragraph 1</a> extends the scope of Article 6 to include not only income derived from immovable property as defined in <a href="#A006-P002">paragraph 2</a> but also income from activities that constitute agriculture or forestry. Income from agriculture and forestry includes not only the income that an enterprise engaged in agriculture or forestry derives from selling its agricultural and forestry production but also income that is an integral part of the carrying on of agriculture or forestry activities — for instance, income derived from the acquisition or trading of emissions permits (the nature of these permits is explained in <a href="#CO007-P075.01">paragraph 75.1</a> of the Commentary on Article 7) where such acquisition or trading is an integral part of the carrying on of agriculture or forestry activities,e.g.where the permits are acquired for the purpose of carrying on these activities or where permits acquired for that purpose are subsequently traded when it is realised that they will not be needed.</p>
<p id="CO006-P002.01"><a href="#CO006-P002.01-R">(Added on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>3.  Paragraph <a href="#A006-P003">3</a>indicates that the general rule applies irrespective of the form of exploitation of the immovable property. Paragraph <a href="#A006-P004">4</a> makes it clear that the provisions of paragraphs <a href="#A006-P001">1</a> and <a href="#A006-P003">3</a> apply also to income from immovable property of industrial, commercial and other enterprises. Income in the form of distributions from Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), however, raises particular issues which are discussed in paragraphs <a href="#CO010-P067.01">67.1</a> to <a href="#CO010-P067.07">67.7</a> of the Commentary on Article 10.</p>
<p id="CO006-P003"><a href="#CO006-P003-R">(Amended on 17 July 2008 see History)</a></p>
<p>4.  It should be noted in this connection that the right to tax of the State of source has priority over the right to tax of the other State and applies also where, in the case of an enterprise, income is only indirectly derived from immovable property. This does not prevent income from immovable property, when derived through a permanent establishment, from being treated as income of an enterprise, but secures that income from immovable property will be taxed in the State in which the property is situated also in the case where such property is not part of a permanent establishment situated in that State. It should further be noted that the provisions of the Article do not prejudge the application of domestic law as regards the manner in which income from immovable property is to be taxed.</p>

All Double Taxation Conventions in force give the right to tax income from immovable property to the State of source, that is, the State in which the property producing such income is situated.

The rule laid down in paragraph 1 of the Article is in conformity with this practice.”</p>
