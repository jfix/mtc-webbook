<h1 id="concerning-the-taxation-of-entertainers-and-sportspersons">CONCERNING THE TAXATION OF entertainers AND SPORTSpersons<a class="headerlink" href="#concerning-the-taxation-of-entertainers-and-sportspersons" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p><paragraphsection><title>Paragraph 1</title>1.  <a href="#A017-P001">Paragraph 1</a>provides that entertainers and sportspersons who are residents of a Contracting State may be taxed in the other Contracting State in which their personal activities as such are performed, whether these are of a business or employment nature. This provision is an exception to the rules in <a href="#A007">Article 7</a> (over which it prevails by virtue of <a href="#A007-P004">paragraph 4</a> of that Article) and to that in <a href="#A015-P002">paragraph 2</a> of Article 15, respectively.</p>
<p id="CO017-P001"><a href="#CO017-P001-R">(Amended on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>2.  This provision makes it possible to avoid the practical difficulties which often arise in taxing entertainers and sportspersons performing abroad. Moreover, too strict provisions might in certain cases impede cultural exchanges. In order to overcome this disadvantage, the States concerned may, by common agreement, limit the application of <a href="#A017-P001">paragraph 1</a> to business activities. To achieve this it would be sufficient to replace the words “notwithstanding the provisions of <a href="#A015">Article 15</a>” by “subject to the provisions of Article 15” in paragraphs <a href="#A017-P001">1</a> and <a href="#CO017-P002">2</a>. In such a case, entertainers and sportspersons performing in the course of an employment would automatically come within <a href="#A015">Article 15</a> and thus be entitled to the exemptions provided for in <a href="#A017-P002">paragraph 2</a> of that Article.</p>
<p id="CO017-P002"><a href="#CO017-P002-R">(Amended on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>3.  <a href="#A017-P001">Paragraph 1</a>refers to entertainers and sportspersons. It is not possible to give a precise definition of “entertainer”, but <a href="#A017-P001">paragraph 1</a> includes examples of persons who would be regarded as such. These examples should not be considered as exhaustive. On the one hand, the term “entertainer” clearly includes the stage performer, film actor or actor (including for instance a former sportsperson) in a television commercial. The Article may also apply to income received from activities which involve a political, social, religious or charitable nature, if an entertainment character is present. On the other hand, it does not extend to a visiting conference speaker (e.g.a former politician who receives a fee for a speaking engagement), to a model performing as such (e.g.a model presenting clothes during a fashion show or photo session) rather than as an entertainer or to administrative or support staff (e.g.cameramen for a film, producers, film directors, choreographers, technical staff, road crew for a pop group, etc.). In between there is a grey area where it is necessary to review the overall balance of the activities of the person concerned.</p>
<p id="CO017-P003"><a href="#CO017-P003-R">(Amended on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>4.  An individual may both direct a show and act in it, or may direct and produce a television programme or film and take a role in it. In such cases it is necessary to look at what the individual actually does in the State where the performance takes place. If his activities in that State are predominantly of a performing nature, the Article will apply to all the resulting income he derives in that State. If, however, the performing element is a negligible part of what he does in that State, the whole of the income will fall outside the Article. In other cases an apportionment should be necessary.</p>
<p id="CO017-P004"><a href="#CO017-P004-R">(Replaced on 23 July 1992 see History)</a></p>
<p>5.  Whilst no precise definition is given of the term “sportspersons” it is not restricted to participants in traditional athletic events (e.g.runners, jumpers, swimmers). It also covers, for example, golfers, jockeys, footballers, cricketers and tennis players, as well as racing drivers.</p>
<p id="CO017-P005"><a href="#CO017-P005-R">(Amended on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>6.  The Article also applies to income from other activities which are usually regarded as of an entertainment character, such as those deriving from billiards and snooker, chess and bridge tournaments.</p>
<p id="CO017-P006"><a href="#CO017-P006-R">(Replaced on 23 July 1992 see History)</a></p>
<p>7.  Income received by impresarios, etc. for arranging the appearance of an entertainer or sportsperson is outside the scope of the Article, but any income they receive on behalf of the entertainer or sportsperson is of course covered by it.</p>
<p id="CO017-P007"><a href="#CO017-P007-R">(Amended on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>8.  <a href="#A017-P001">Paragraph 1</a>applies to income derived directly and indirectly from a performance by an individual entertainer or sportsperson. In some cases the income will not be paid to the individual, or his impresario or agent, directly with respect to a specific performance. For instance, a member of an orchestra may be paid a salary rather than receive payment for each separate performance: a Contracting State where a performance takes place is entitled, under <a href="#A017-P001">paragraph 1</a>, to tax the proportion of the musician’s salary which corresponds to such a performance. Similarly, where an entertainer or sportsperson is employed bye.g.a one person company, the State where the performance takes place may tax an appropriate proportion of any remuneration paid to the individual. In addition, where a State’s domestic laws “look through” such entities and treat the income as accruing directly to the individual, <a href="#A017-P001">paragraph 1</a> enables that State to tax income derived from performances in its territory and accruing in the entity for the individual’s benefit, even if the income is not actually paid as remuneration to the individual.</p>
<p id="CO017-P008"><a href="#CO017-P008-R">(Amended on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>8.1  The paragraph applies regardless of who pays the income. For example, it covers prizes and awards paid by a national federation, association or league which a team or an individual may receive in relation to a particular sports event.</p>
<p id="CO017-P008.01"><a href="#CO017-P008.01-R">(Added on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>9.  Besides fees for their actual performances, entertainers and sportspersons often receive income in the form of royalties or of sponsorship or advertising fees. In general, other Articles would apply whenever there is no close connection between the income and the performance of activities in the country concerned. Such a close connection will generally be found to exist where it cannot reasonably be considered that the income would have been derived in the absence of the performance of these activities. This connection may be related to the timing of the income-generating event (e.g.a payment received by a professional golfer for an interview given during a tournament in which she participates) or to the nature of the consideration for the payment of the income (e.g.a payment made to a star tennis player for the use of his picture on posters advertising a tournament in which he will participate). Royalties for intellectual property rights will normally be covered by <a href="#A012">Article 12</a> rather than <a href="#A017">Article 17</a> (see <a href="#CO012-P018">paragraph 18</a> of the Commentary on Article 12), but in general advertising and sponsorship fees will fall outside the scope of <a href="#A012">Article 12</a>. <a href="#A017">Article 17</a>will apply to advertising or sponsorship income, etc. which has a close connection with a performance in a given State (e.g.payments made to a tennis player for wearing a sponsor’s logo, trade mark or trade name on his tennis shirt during a match). Such a close connection may be evident from contractual arrangements which relate to participation in named events or a number of unspecified events; in the latter case, a Contracting State in which one or more of these events take place may tax a proportion of the relevant advertising or sponsorship income (as it would do, for example, in the case of remuneration covering a number of unspecified performances; see paragraphs <a href="#CO017-P009.02">9.2</a> and <a href="#CO017-P009.03">9.3</a>). Similar income which could not be attributed to such performances would fall under the standard rules of <a href="#A007">Article 7</a> or <a href="#A015">Article 15</a>, as appropriate. Payments received in the event of the cancellation of a performance are also outside the scope of <a href="#A017">Article 17</a>, and fall under <a href="#A007">Article 7</a> or <a href="#A015">15</a>, as the case may be. Various payments may be made as regards merchandising; whilst the payment to an entertainer or sportsperson of a share of the merchandising income closely connected with a public performance but not constituting royalties would normally fall under <a href="#A017">Article 17</a>, merchandising payments derived from sales in a country that are not closely connected with performances in that country and that do not constitute royalties would normally be covered by <a href="#A007">Article 7</a>(or <a href="#A015">Article 15</a>, in the case of an employee receiving such income).</p>
<p id="CO017-P009"><a href="#CO017-P009-R">(Amended on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>9.1  Apart from the above examples, there are a number of cases where it may be difficult to determine whether a particular item of income is derived by a person as an entertainer or sportsperson from that person’s personal activities as such. The following principles may be useful to deal with such cases:<itemizedlist></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The reference to an “entertainer or sportsperson” includes anyone who acts as such, even for a single event. Thus, <a href="#A017">Article 17</a> can apply to an amateur who wins a monetary sports prize or a person who is not an actor but who gets a fee for a once-in-a-lifetime appearance in a television commercial or movie.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As noted in the previous paragraphs, the activities of an entertainer or sportsperson do not include only the appearance in an entertainment or sports event in a given State but also, for example, advertising or interviews in that State that are closely connected with such an appearance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Merely reporting or commenting on an entertainment or sports event in which the reporter does not himself participate is not an activity of an entertainer or sportsperson acting as such. Thus, for instance, the fee that a former or injured sportsperson would earn for offering comments during the broadcast of a sports event in which that person does not participate would not be covered by <a href="#A017">Article 17</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preparation, such as rehearsal and training, is part of the normal activities of entertainers and sportspersons. If an entertainer or sportsperson is remunerated for time spent on rehearsal, training or similar preparation in a State (which would be fairly common for employed entertainers and sportspersons but could also happen for a self-employed individual, such as an opera singer whose contract would require participation in a certain number of rehearsals), the relevant remuneration, as well as remuneration for time spent travelling in that State for the purposes of performances, rehearsal and training (or similar preparation), would be covered by the Article. This would apply regardless of whether or not such rehearsal, training or similar preparation is related to specific public performances taking place in that State (e.g.remuneration that would be paid with respect to the participation in a pre-season training camp would be covered).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></itemizedlist></p>
<p id="CO017-P009.01"><a href="#CO017-P009.01-R">(Added on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>9.2  Entertainers and sportspersons often perform their activities in different States making it necessary to determine which part of their income is derived from activities exercised in each State. Whilst such determination must be based on the facts and circumstances of each case, the following general principles will be relevant for that purpose:<itemizedlist></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An element of income that is closely connected with specific activities exercised by the entertainer or sportsperson in a State (e.g.a prize paid to the winner of a sports competition taking place in that State; a daily allowance paid with respect to participation in a tournament or training stage taking place in that State; a payment made to a musician for a concert given in a State) will be considered to be derived from the activities exercised in that State.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As indicated in <a href="#CO015-P001">paragraph 1</a>of the Commentary on Article 15, employment is exercised where the employee is physically present when performing the activities for which the employment remuneration is paid. Where the remuneration received by an entertainer or sportsperson employed by a team, troupe or orchestra covers various activities to be performed during a period of time (e.g.an annual salary covering various activities such as training or rehearsing; travelling with the team, troupe or orchestra; participating in a match or public performance, etc.), it will therefore be appropriate, absent any indication that the remuneration or part thereof should be allocated differently, to allocate that salary or remuneration on the basis of the working days spent in each State in which the entertainer or sportsperson has been required, under his or her employment contract, to perform these activities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></itemizedlist></p>
<p id="CO017-P009.02"><a href="#CO017-P009.02-R">(Added on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>9.3  The following examples illustrate these principles:<itemizedlist></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Example 1: A self-employed singer is paid a fixed amount for a number of concerts to be performed in different states plus 5 per cent of the ticket sales for each concert. In that case, it would be appropriate to allocate the fixed amount on the basis of the number of concerts performed in each State but to allocate the payments based on ticket sales on the basis of where the concerts that generated each such payment took place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Example 2: A cyclist is employed by a team. Under his employment contract, he is required to travel with the team, appear in some public press conferences organised by the team and participate in training activities and races that take place in different countries. He is paid a fixed annual salary plus bonuses based on his results in particular races. In that case, it would be reasonable to allocate the salary on the basis of the number of working days during which he is present in each State where his employment-related activities (e.g.travel, training, races, public appearances) are performed and to allocate the bonuses to where the relevant races took place.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></itemizedlist></p>
<p id="CO017-P009.03"><a href="#CO017-P009.03-R">(Added on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>9.4  Payments for the simultaneous broadcasting of a performance by an entertainer or sportsperson made directly to the performer or for his or her benefit (e.g.a payment made to the star-company of the performer) fall within the scope of <a href="#A017">Article 17</a> (see <a href="#CO012-P018">paragraph 18</a> of the Commentary on Article 12, which also deals with payments for the subsequent sales or public playing of recordings of the performance). Where, however, the payment is made to a third party (e.g.the owner of the broadcasting rights) and that payment does not benefit the performer, the payment is not related to the personal activities of the performer and therefore does not constitute income derived by a person as an entertainer or sportsperson from that person’s personal activities as such. For example, where the organiser of a football tournament holds all intellectual property rights in the event and, as such, receives payments for broadcasting rights related to the event, <a href="#A017">Article 17</a> does not apply to these payments; similarly, <a href="#A017">Article 17</a> will not apply to any share of these payments that will be distributed to the participating teams and will not be re-distributed to the players and that is not otherwise paid for the benefit of the players. Whether such payments will constitute royalties covered by <a href="#A012">Article 12</a> will depend, among other things, on the legal nature of such broadcasting rights, in particular under the relevant copyright law.</p>
<p id="CO017-P009.04"><a href="#CO017-P009.04-R">(Added on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>9.5  It is frequent for entertainers and sportspersons to derive, directly or indirectly (e.g.through a payment made to the star-company of the entertainer or sportsperson), a substantial part of their income in the form of payments for the use of, or the right to use, their “image rights”,e.g.the use of their name, signature or personal image. Where such uses of the entertainer’s or sportsperson’s image rights are not closely connected with the entertainer’s or sportsperson’s performance in a given State, the relevant payments would generally not be covered by <a href="#A017">Article 17</a> (see paragraph 9 above). There are cases, however, where payments made to an entertainer or sportsperson who is a resident of a Contracting State, or to another person, for the use of, or right to use, that entertainer’s or sportsperson’s image rights constitute in substance remuneration for activities of the entertainer or sportsperson that are covered by <a href="#A017">Article 17</a> and that take place in the other Contracting State. In such cases, the provisions of <a href="#A017-P001">paragraph 1</a> or <a href="#A017-P002">2</a>, depending on the circumstances, will be applicable.</p>
<p id="CO017-P009.05"><a href="#CO017-P009.05-R">(Added on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p id="">10.  The Article says nothing about how the income in question is to be computed. It is for a Contracting State’s domestic law to determine the extent of any deductions for expenses. Domestic laws differ in this area, and some provide for taxation at source, at a low rate based on the gross amount paid to entertainers and sportspersons. Such rules may also apply to income paid to groups or incorporated teams, troupes, etc. Some States, however, may consider that the taxation of the gross amount may be inappropriate in some circumstances even if the applicable rate is low. These States may want to give the option to the taxpayer to be taxed on a net basis. This could be done through the inclusion of a paragraph drafted along the following lines:Where a resident of a Contracting State derives income referred to in paragraph <a href="#A017-P001">1</a> or <a href="#CO017-P002">2</a> and such income is taxable in the other Contracting State on a gross basis, that person may, within [period to be determined by the Contracting States] request the other State in writing that the income be taxable on a net basis in that other State. Such request shall be allowed by that other State. In determining the taxable income of such resident in the other State, there shall be allowed as deductions those expenses deductible under the domestic laws of the other State which are incurred for the purposes of the activities exercised in the other State and which are available to a resident of the other State exercising the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions.</p>
<p id="CO017-P010"><a href="#CO017-P010-R">(Amended on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p id="">10.1  Some States may also consider that it would be inappropriate to apply <a href="#A017">Article 17</a> to a non-resident entertainer or sportsperson who would not otherwise be taxable in a Contracting State (e.g.under the provisions of <a href="#A007">Article 7</a> or <a href="#A015">15</a>) and who, during a given taxation year, derives only low amounts of income from activities performed in that State. States wishing to exclude such situations from the application of <a href="#A017">Article 17</a>may do so by using an alternative version of <a href="#A017-P001">paragraph 1</a> drafted along the following lines:Notwithstanding the provisions of <a href="#A015">Article 15</a>, income derived by a resident of a Contracting State as an entertainer, such as a theatre, motion picture, radio, or television artiste, or a musician, or as a sportsperson, from his personal activities as such exercised in the other Contracting State, may be taxed in that other State, except where the gross amount of such income derived by that resident from these activities exercised during a taxation year of the other Contracting State does not exceed an amount equivalent to [15 000 IMF Special Drawing Rights] expressed in the currency of that other State at the beginning of that taxation year or any other amount agreed to by the competent authorities before, and with respect to, that taxation year.</p>
<p id="CO017-P010.01"><a href="#CO017-P010.01-R">(Added on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>10.2  The amount referred to in the above provision is purely illustrative. The reference to “IMF Special Drawing Rights” avoids the reference to the currency of one of the two Contracting States and is intended to provide an amount that remains relatively constant in value regardless of currency fluctuations in each State (the IMF Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) are based on a basket of currencies revised periodically and are easily expressed in most convertible currencies). Also, for ease of administration, the proposed provision provides that the limit applicable in a State for a given taxation year is the amount converted in the currency of that State at the beginning of that year. The proposed provision also allows competent authorities to modify the amount when they consider it appropriate; instead of adopting a static amount, however, some States may prefer to adopt an objective mechanism that would allow periodic changes (this could be done, for example, by replacing the amount by a formula such as “50 per cent of the average GDP per capita for OECD countries, as determined by the OECD”).</p>

<p>10.3  The proposed provision would not prevent Contracting States from collecting tax at the time the relevant income is earned and refunding it after the end of the year once it is established that the minimum amount has not been exceeded.</p>
<p id="CO017-P010.03"><a href="#CO017-P010.03-R">(Added on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>10.4  The proposed provision only applies with respect to <a href="#A017-P001">paragraph 1</a> (applying the rule with respect to other persons covered by <a href="#A017-P002">paragraph 2</a> could encourage a fragmentation of contracts among many related entities in order to multiply the benefit of the exception). Also, the provision only restricts the additional taxing right recognised by <a href="#A017">Article 17</a> and does not affect the source taxing rights otherwise available under Articles 7 and <a href="#A015">15</a>. It would therefore not prevent taxation to the extent that the entertainer has a permanent establishment in the State of source or is present in that State for more than 183 days (or is employed by an employer who is a resident of that State or has permanent establishment in that State).</p>

<p></paragraphsection><paragraphsection><title>Paragraph 2</title>11.  <a href="#A017-P001">Paragraph 1</a>of the Article deals with income derived by individual entertainers and sportspersons from their personal activities. <a href="#A017-P002">Paragraph 2</a> deals with situations where income from their activities accrues to other persons. If the income of an entertainer or sportsperson accrues to another person, and the State of source does not have the statutory right to look through the person receiving the income to tax it as income of the performer, <a href="#A017-P002">paragraph 2</a> provides that the portion of the income which cannot be taxed in the hands of the performer may be taxed in the hands of the person receiving the remuneration. If the person receiving the income carries on business activities, tax may be applied by the source country even if the income is not attributable to a permanent establishment there. But it will not always be so. There are three main situations of this kind:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The first is the management company which receives income for the appearance ofe.g.a group of sportspersons (which is not itself constituted as a legal entity).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second is the team, troupe, orchestra, etc. which is constituted as a legal entity. Income for performances may be paid to the entity. Individual members of the team, orchestra, etc. will be liable to tax under <a href="#A017-P001">paragraph 1</a>, in the State in which they perform their activities as entertainers or sportspersons, on any remuneration (or income accruing for their benefit) derived from the performance of these activities (see, however, paragraph <a href="#CO017-P014.01">14.1</a> below). The profit element accruing from a performance to the legal entity would be liable to tax under <a href="#A017-P002">paragraph 2</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The third situation involves certain tax avoidance devices in cases where remuneration for the performance of an entertainer or sportsperson is not paid to the entertainer or sportsperson himself but to another person,e.g.a so-called star-company, in such a way that the income is taxed in the State where the activity is performed neither as personal service income to the entertainer or sportsperson nor as profits of the enterprise, in the absence of a permanent establishment. Some countries “look through” such arrangements under their domestic law and deem the income to be derived by the entertainer or sportsperson; where this is so, <a href="#A017-P001">paragraph 1</a> enables them to tax income resulting from activities in their territory. Other countries cannot do this. Where a performance takes place in such a country, <a href="#A017-P002">paragraph 2</a>permits it to impose a tax on the profits diverted from the income of the entertainer or sportsperson to the enterprise. It may be, however, that the domestic laws of some States do not enable them to apply such a provision. Such States are free to agree to other solutions or to leave <a href="#A017-P002">paragraph 2</a> out of their bilateral conventions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#CO017-P011-R">(Amended on 15 July 2014 see History)</a>11.1  The application of <a href="#A017-P002">paragraph 2</a> is not restricted to situations where both the entertainer or sportsperson and the other person to whom the income accrues,e.g.a star-company, are residents of the same Contracting State. The paragraph allows the State in which the activities of an entertainer or sportsperson are exercised to tax the income derived from these activities and accruing to another person regardless of other provisions of the Convention that may otherwise be applicable. Thus, notwithstanding the provisions of <a href="#A007">Article 7</a>, the paragraph allows that State to tax the income derived by a star-company resident of the other Contracting State even where the entertainer or sportsperson is not a resident of that other State. Conversely, where the income of an entertainer resident in one of the Contracting States accrues to a person,e.g.a star-company, who is a resident of a third State with which the State of source does not have a tax convention, nothing will prevent the Contracting State from taxing that person in accordance with its domestic laws.</p>
<p id="CO017-P011.01"><a href="#CO017-P011.01-R">(Amended on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>11.2  <a href="#A017-P002">Paragraph 2</a> does not apply, however, to prize money that the owner of a horse or the team to which a race car belongs derives from the results of the horse or car during a race or during races taking place during a certain period. In such a case, the prize money is not paid in consideration for the personal activities of the jockey or race car driver but in consideration for the activities related to the ownership and training of the horse or the design, construction, ownership and maintenance of the car. Such prize money is not derived from the personal activities of the jockey or race car driver and is not covered by <a href="#A017">Article 17</a>. Clearly, however, if the owner or team receives a payment in consideration for the personal activities of the jockey or race car driver, that income may be taxed in the hands of the jockey or race car driver under <a href="#A017-P001">paragraph 1</a> (see <a href="#CO017-P007">paragraph 7</a> above).</p>
<p id="CO017-P011.02"><a href="#CO017-P011.02-R">(Replaced on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>11.3  As a general rule it should be noted, however, that, regardless of <a href="#A007">Article 7</a>, the Convention would not prevent the application of general anti-avoidance rules of the domestic law of the State of source which would allow that State to tax either the entertainer/sportsperson or the star-company in abusive cases, as is recognised in <a href="#CO001-P022">paragraphs 22</a>and <a href="#CO001-P022.01">22.1</a> of the Commentary on Article 1.</p>
<p id="CO017-P011.03"><a href="#CO017-P011.03-R">(Renumbered and amended on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>11.4  <a href="#A017-P002">Paragraph 2</a> covers income that may be considered to be derived in respect of the personal activities of an entertainer or sportsperson. Whilst that covers income that is received by an enterprise that is paid for performing such activities (such as a sports team or orchestra), it clearly does not cover the income of all enterprises that are involved in the production of entertainment or sports events. For example, the income derived by the independent promoter of a concert from the sale of tickets and allocation of advertising space is not covered by <a href="#A017-P002">paragraph 2</a>.</p>
<p id="CO017-P0011.04"><a href="#CO017-P011.04-R">(Added on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>11.5  Whilst the Article does not provide how the income covered by paragraphs <a href="#A017-P001">1</a> and <a href="#CO017-P002">2</a> is to be computed and leaves it to the domestic law of a Contracting State to determine the extent of any deductions (see paragraph 10 above), the income derived in respect of the personal activities of a sportsperson or entertainer should not be taxed twice through the application of these two paragraphs. This will be an important consideration where, for example, <a href="#A017-P002">paragraph 2</a> allows a Contracting State to tax the star-company of an entertainer on a payment received by that company with respect to activities performed by the entertainer in that State and <a href="#A017-P001">paragraph 1</a> also allows that State to tax the part of the remuneration paid by that company to the entertainer that can reasonably be attributed to these activities. In that case, the Contracting State may, depending on its domestic law, either tax only the company or the entertainer on the whole income attributable to these activities or tax each of them on part of the income,e.g.by taxing the income received by the company but allowing a deduction for the relevant part of the remuneration paid to the entertainer and taxing that part in the hands of the entertainer.</p>

<p></paragraphsection>## Additional considerations relating to paragraphs <a href="#A017-P001">1</a> and <a href="#A017-P002">2</a></p>
<p>12.  Where, in the cases dealt with in paragraphs <a href="#A017-P001">1</a> and <a href="#A017-P002">2</a>, the exemption method for relieving double taxation is used by the State of residence of the person receiving the income, that State would be precluded from taxing such income even if the State where the activities were performed could not make use of its right to tax. It is therefore understood that the credit method should be used in such cases. The same result could be achieved by stipulating a subsidiary right to tax for the State of residence of the person receiving the income, if the State where the activities are performed cannot make use of the right conferred on it by paragraphs <a href="#A017-P001">1</a> and <a href="#A017-P002">2</a>. Contracting States are free to choose any of these methods in order to ensure that the income does not escape taxation.</p>
<p id="CO017-P012"><a href="#CO017-P012-R">(Renumbered and amended on 23 July 1992 see History)</a></p>
<p>13.  <a href="#A017">Article 17</a> will ordinarily apply when the entertainer or sportsperson is employed by a Government and derives income from that Government; see <a href="#CO019-P006">paragraph 6</a> of the Commentary on Article 19. Certain conventions contain provisions excluding entertainers or sportspersons employed in organisations which are subsidised out of public funds from the application of <a href="#A017">Article 17</a>.</p>
<p id="CO017-P013"><a href="#CO017-P013-R">(Amended on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p id="">14.  Some countries may consider it appropriate to exclude from the scope of the Article events supported from public funds. Such countries are free to include a provision to achieve this but the exemptions should be based on clearly definable and objective criteria to ensure that they are given only where intended. Such a provision might read as follows:The provisions of paragraphs <a href="#A017-P001">1</a>and <a href="#CO017-P002">2</a> shall not apply to income derived from activities performed in a Contracting State by entertainers or sportspersons if the visit to that State is wholly or mainly supported by public funds of one or both of the Contracting States or political subdivisions or local authorities thereof. In such a case, the income is taxable only in the Contracting State in which the entertainer or the sportsperson is a resident.</p>
<p id="CO017-P014"><a href="#CO017-P014-R">(Amended on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p id="">14.1  Also, given the administrative difficulties involved in allocating to specific activities taking place in a State the overall employment remuneration of individual members of a foreign team, troupe or orchestra, and in taxing the relevant part of that remuneration, some States may consider it appropriate not to tax such remuneration. Whilst a State could unilaterally decide to exempt such remuneration, such a unilateral solution would not be reciprocal and would give rise to the problem described in paragraph 12 above where the exemption method is used by the State of residence of the person deriving such income. These States may therefore consider it appropriate to exclude such remuneration from the scope of the Article. Whilst <a href="#A017-P002">paragraph 2</a> above indicates that one solution would be to amend the text of the Article so that it does not apply with respect to income from employment, some States may prefer a narrower exception dealing with cases that they frequently encounter in practice. The following is an example of a provision applicable to members of a sports team that could be used for that purpose:The provisions of <a href="#A017">Article 17</a> shall not apply to income derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of personal activities of an individual exercised in the other Contracting State as a sportsperson member of a team of the first-mentioned State that takes part in a match organised in the other State by a league to which that team belongs.</p>

<p>15.1  <em>France</em> considers that the statement in the first sentence of <a href="#CO017-P013">paragraph 13</a>, which is at variance with the wording prior to the 1995 revision, is incorrect, because it does not conform with reality to characterisea priorias business the public activities at issue — and in particular cultural activities — that do not ordinarily have a profit motive. In addition, this statement is not consistent with the second sentence of the same paragraph or with <a href="#CO017-P014">paragraph 14</a>, which explicitly provides the right to apply a special exemption regime to the public activities in question: if applied generally to business activities, such a regime would be unjustified, because it would then be contrary to fiscal neutrality and tax equality.</p>

Switzerland considers that advertising or sponsorship income falls under the standard rules of <a href="#A007">Article 7</a> or <a href="#A015">Article 15</a>, as appropriate, even if such income has a close connection with a performance in a given State. Additionally, Switzerland takes the view that merchandising income and income in the form of payments for the use of, or the right to use, image rights (<a href="#CO017-P009.05">paragraph 9.5</a> of the Commentary) are not covered by <a href="#A017">Article 17</a>.</p>

On the other hand, it does not extend to a visiting conference speaker or to administrative or support staff (e.g.cameramen for a film, producers, film directors, choreographers, technical staff, road crew for a pop group etc.). In between there is a grey area where it is necessary to review the overall balance of the activities of the person concerned.”</p>
<p>Paragraph 3 of the 1977 Model Convention was replaced on 23 July 1992 when it was amended and renumbered as paragraph 13 (see history of paragraph 13) and a new paragraph 3 was added by the report entitled “The Revision of the Model Convention”, adopted by the OECD Council on 23 July 1992, on the basis of paragraphs 68 and 72 of a previous report entitled “The Taxation of Income Derived from Entertainment, Artistic and Sporting Activities” (adopted by the OECD Council on 27 March 1987).</p>

After 23 July 1992 and until 15 July 2014, paragraph 5 read as follows:“5.  Whilst no precise definition is given of the term “sportsmen” it is not restricted to participants in traditional athletic events (e.g.runners, jumpers, swimmers). It also covers, for example, golfers, jockeys, footballers, cricketers and tennis players, as well as racing drivers.”</p>

After 23 July 1992 and until 15 July 2014, paragraph 8 read as follows:“8.  Paragraph 1 applies to income derived directly and indirectly by an individual artiste or sportsman. In some cases the income will not be paid directly to the individual or his impresario or agent. For instance, a member of an orchestra may be paid a salary rather than receive payment for each separate performance: a Contracting State where a performance takes place is entitled, under paragraph 1, to tax the proportion of the musician’s salary which corresponds to such a performance. Similarly, where an artiste or sportsman is employed bye.g.a one person company, the State where the performance takes place may tax an appropriate proportion of any remuneration paid to the individual. In addition, where its domestic laws “look through” such entities and treat the income as accruing directly to the individual, paragraph 1 enables that State to tax income derived from appearances in its territory and accruing in the entity for the individual’s benefit, even if the income is not actually paid as remuneration to the individual.”</p>
<p>Paragraph 8 of the 1977 Model Convention was replaced on 23 July 1992 when it was amended and renumbered as paragraph 18 (see history of paragraph 18) and a new paragraph 8 was added by the report entitled “The Revision of the Model Convention”, adopted by the OECD Council on 23 July 1992, on the basis of paragraph 76 of a previous report entitled “The Taxation of Income Derived from Entertainment, Artistic and Sporting Activities” (adopted by the OECD Council on 27 March 1987).</p>

After 29 April 2000 and until 15 July 2014, paragraph 9 read as follows:“9.  Besides fees for their actual appearances, artistes and sportsmen often receive income in the form of royalties or of sponsorship or advertising fees. In general, other Articles would apply whenever there was no direct link between the income and a public exhibition by the performer in the country concerned.

After 17 July 2008 and until 15 July 2014, paragraph 15 read as follows:“10.  The Article says nothing about how the income in question is to be computed. It is for a Contracting State’s domestic law to determine the extent of any deductions for expenses. Domestic laws differ in this area, and some provide for taxation at source, at a low rate based on the gross amount paid to artistes and sportsmen. Such rules may also apply to income paid to groups or incorporated teams, troupes, etc. Some States, however, may consider that the taxation of the gross amount may be inappropriate in some circumstances even if the applicable rate is low. These States may want to give the option to the taxpayer to be taxed on a net basis. This could be done through the inclusion of a paragraph drafted along the following lines:Where a resident of a Contracting State derives income referred to in paragraph 1 or 2 and such income is taxable in the other Contracting State on a gross basis, that person may, within [period to be determined by the Contracting States] request the other State in writing that the income be taxable on a net basis in that other State. Such request shall be allowed by that other State. In determining the taxable income of such resident in the other State, there shall be allowed as deductions those expenses deductible under the domestic laws of the other State which are incurred for the purposes of the activities exercised in the other State and which are available to a resident of the other State exercising the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions.”</p>

<p><strong><a href="#CO017-P011">Paragraph 11</a></strong>: Amended on 15 July 2014 by the Report entitled “The 2014 Update to the Model Tax Convention”, adopted by the Council of the OECD on 15 July 2014, on the basis of another report entitled “Issues related to Article 17 of the OECD Model Tax Convention” (adopted by the OECD Committee on Fiscal Affairs on 26 June 2014). After 29 April 2000 and until 15 July 2014, paragraph 11 read as follows:“11.  Paragraph 1 of the Article deals with income derived by individual artistes and sportsmen from their personal activities. Paragraph 2 deals with situations where income from their activities accrues to other persons. If the income of an entertainer or sportsman accrues to another person, and the State of source does not have the statutory right to look through the person receiving the income to tax it as income of the performer, paragraph 2 provides that the portion of the income which cannot be taxed in the hands of the performer may be taxed in the hands of the person receiving the remuneration. If the person receiving the income carries on business activities, tax may be applied by the source country even if the income is not attributable to a permanent establishment there. But it will not always be so. There are three main situations of this kind:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The first is the management company which receives income for the appearance ofe.g.a group of sportsmen (which is not itself constituted as a legal entity).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second is the team, troupe, orchestra, etc. which is constituted as a legal entity. Income for performances may be paid to the entity. Individual members of the team, orchestra, etc. will be liable to tax under paragraph 1, in the State in which a performance is given, on any remuneration (or income accruing for their benefit) as a counterpart to the performance; however, if the members are paid a fixed periodic remuneration and it would be difficult to allocate a portion of that income to particular performances, member countries may decide, unilaterally or bilaterally, not to tax it. The profit element accruing from a performance to the legal entity would be liable to tax under paragraph 2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The third situation involves certain tax avoidance devices in cases where remuneration for the performance of an artiste or sportsman is not paid to the artiste or sportsman himself but to another person,e.g.a so-called artiste company, in such a way that the income is taxed in the State where the activity is performed neither as personal service income to the artiste or sportsman nor as profits of the enterprise, in the absence of a permanent establishment. Some countries “look through” such arrangements under their domestic law and deem the income to be derived by the artiste or sportsman; where this is so, paragraph 1 enables them to tax income resulting from activities in their territory. Other countries cannot do this. Where a performance takes place in such a country, paragraph 2 permits it to impose a tax on the profits diverted from the income of the artiste or sportsman to the enterprise. It may be, however, that the domestic laws of some States do not enable them to apply such a provision. Such States are free to agree to other solutions or to leave paragraph 2 out of their bilateral conventions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p id="">Paragraph 11 was previously amended on 29 April 2000 by replacing the words “is an enterprise” with “carries on business activities” in the forth sentence and deleting the fifth sentence which read “If the person receiving the income is an individual, the income may be taxed even in the absence of a fixed base.”, by the report entitled “The 2000 Update to the Model Tax Convention”, adopted by the OECD Committee on Fiscal Affairs on 29 April 2000 on the basis of the Annex of another report entitled “Issues Related to Article 14 of the OECD Model Tax Convention” (adopted by the OECD Committee on Fiscal Affairs on 27 January 2000). After 23 July 1992 and until 29 April 2000, the preamble of paragraph 11 read as follows:“11.  Paragraph 1 of the Article deals with income derived by individual artistes and sportsmen from their personal activities. Paragraph 2 deals with situations where income from their activities accrues to other persons.

<p>Subparagraph <em>b)</em> of paragraph 11 was previously amended on 21 September 1995 by the report entitled “The 1995 Update to the Model Tax Convention”, adopted by the OECD Council on 21 September 1995.

<p id="">Paragraph 11 as it read after 23 July 1992 corresponded in part to paragraph 4 of the 1977 Model Convention.

In the 1977 Model Convention, adopted by the OECD Council on 11 April 1977, and until 23 July 1992, paragraph 4 read as follows:“4.  The purpose of paragraph 2 is to counteract certain tax avoidance devices in cases where remuneration for the performance of an entertainer or athlete is not paid to the entertainer or athlete himself but to another person,e.g.a so-called artiste-company, in such a way that the income is taxed in the State where the activity is performed neither as personal service income to the entertainer or athlete nor as profits of the enterprise in the absence of a permanent establishment. Paragraph 2 permits the State in which the performance is given to impose a tax on the profits diverted from the income of the entertainer or athlete to the enterprise where for instance the entertainer or athlete has control over or rights to the income thus diverted or has obtained or will obtain some benefit directly or indirectly from that income. It may be, however, that the domestic laws of some States do not enable them to apply such a provision. Such States are free to agree to alternative solutions or to leave paragraph 2 out of their bilateral convention.”</p>

After 29 April 2000 and until 15 July 2014, paragraph 11.1 read as follows:“11.1  The application of paragraph 2 is not restricted to situations where both the entertainer or sportsman and the other person to whom the income accrues,e.g.a star-company, are residents of the same Contracting State. The paragraph allows the State in which the activities of an entertainer or sportsman are exercised to tax the income derived from these activities and accruing to another person regardless of other provisions of the Convention that may otherwise be applicable. Thus, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 7, the paragraph allows that State to tax the income derived by a star-company resident of the other Contracting State even where the entertainer or sportsman is not a resident of that other State. Conversely, where the income of an entertainer resident in one of the Contracting States accrues to a person,e.g.a star-company, who is a resident of a third State with which the State of source does not have a tax convention, nothing will prevent the Contracting State from taxing that person in accordance with its domestic laws.”</p>

After 29 April 2000 and until 15 July 2014, paragraph 11.2 read as follows:“11.2  As a general rule it should be noted, however, that, regardless of Article 7, the Convention would not prevent the application of general anti-avoidance rules of the domestic law of the State of source which would allow that State to tax either the entertainer/sportsman or the star-company in abusive cases, as is recognised in paragraph 24 of the Commentary on Article 1.”</p>

In the 1977 Model Convention and until 23 July 1992, paragraph 5 read as follows:“5.  Where in the cases dealt with in paragraph 2 the exemption method for relieving double taxation is used by the State of residence of the person receiving the income, that State would be precluded from taxing such income even if the State where the activities were performed could not make use of its right to tax. It is therefore understood that the credit method should be used in such cases. The same result could be achieved by stipulating a subsidiary right to tax for the State of residence of the person receiving the income, if the State where the activities are performed cannot make use of the right conferred on it by paragraph 2. Contracting States are free to choose any of these methods in order to ensure that the income does not escape taxation.”</p>

After 21 September 1995 and until 15 July 2014, paragraph 13 read as follows:“13.  Article 17 will ordinarily apply when the artiste or sportsman is employed by a Government and derives income from that Government; see paragraph 6 of the Commentary on Article 19. Certain conventions contain provisions excluding artistes and sportsmen employed in organisations which are subsidised out of public funds from the application of Article 17.”</p>
<p id="">Paragraph 13 was previously amended on 21 September 1995 by the report entitled “The 1995 Update to the Model Tax Convention”, adopted by the OECD Council on 21 September 1995. After 23 July 1992 and until 21 September 1995, paragraph 13 read as follows:“13.  The provisions of the Article do not apply when the artiste or sportsman is employed by a Government and derives the income from that Government.

Certain conventions contain provisions excluding artistes and sportsmen employed in organisations which are subsidised out of public funds from the application of Article 17.”</p>
<p id="">Paragraph 13 as it read after 23 July 1992 corresponded to paragraph 3 of the 1977 Model Convention. On 23 July 1992 paragraph 3 of the 1977 Model Convention was amended and renumbered as paragraph 13 by the report entitled “The Revision of the Model Convention”, adopted by the OECD Council on 23 July 1992. In the 1977 Model Convention and until 23 July 1992, paragraph 3 read as follows:“3.  The provisions of the Article shall not prevent Contracting States from agreeing bilaterally on particular provisions concerning such artistes and sportsmen. The provisions of the Article do not apply when the entertainer or athlete is employed by a Government and derives the income from that Government. Such income is to be treated under the provisions of Article 19. Certain conventions contain provisions excluding entertainers and athletes employed in organisations which are subsidised out of public funds from the application of Article 17. The provisions of the Article shall not prevent Contracting States from agreeing bilaterally on particular provisions concerning such entertainers and athletes.”</p>

After 23 July 1992 and until 15 July 2014, paragraph 14 read as follows:“14.  Some countries may consider it appropriate to exclude from the scope of the Article events supported from public funds. Such countries are free to include a provision to achieve this but the exemptions should be based on clearly definable and objective criteria to ensure that they are given only where intended. Such a provision might read as follows:The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to income derived from activities performed in a Contracting State by artistes or sportsmen if the visit to that State is wholly or mainly supported by public funds of one or both of the Contracting States or political subdivisions or local authorities thereof. In such a case, the income is taxable only in the Contracting State in which the artiste or the sportsman is a resident.”</p>

In addition, this statement is not consistent with the second sentence of the same paragraph or with paragraph 14, which explicitly provides the right to apply a special exemption regime to the public activities in question: if applied generally to industrial or commercial activities, such a regime would be unjustified, because it would then be contrary to fiscal neutrality and tax equality.”</p>
