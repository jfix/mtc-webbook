<p id="V1-I-P016">16.  In both the 1963 Draft Convention and the 1977 Model Convention, the title of the Model Convention included a reference to the elimination of double taxation. In recognition of the fact that the Model Convention does not deal exclusively with the elimination of double taxation but also addresses other issues, such as the prevention of tax evasion and non-discrimination, it was subsequently decided to use a shorter title which did not include this reference. This change has been made both on the cover page of this publication and in the Model Convention itself. However, it is understood that the practice of many member countries is still to include in the title a reference to either the elimination of double taxation or to both the elimination of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion.</p>
<h2 id="broad-lines-of-the-model-convention">Broad lines of the Model Convention<a class="headerlink" href="#broad-lines-of-the-model-convention" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p id="V1-I-P017">17.  The Model Convention first describes its scope (<a href="#C01">Chapter I</a>) and defines some terms (<a href="#C02">Chapter II</a>). The main part is made up of <a href="#C03">Chapters III</a> to <a href="#C05">V</a>, which settle to what extent each of the two Contracting States may tax income and capital and how international juridical double taxation is to be eliminated. Then follow the Special Provisions (<a href="#C06">Chapter VI</a>) and the Final Provisions (entry into force and termination, <a href="#C07">Chapter VII</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Scope and definitions</strong></p>
<p id="V1-I-P018">18.  The Convention applies to all persons who are residents of one or both of the Contracting States (<a href="#A001">Article 1</a>). It deals with taxes on income and on capital, which are described in a general way in <a href="#A002">Article 2</a>. In <a href="#C02">Chapter II</a>, some terms used in more than one Article of the Convention are defined. Other terms such as “dividends”, “interest”, “royalties” and “immovable property” are defined in the Articles that deal with these matters.</p>
<p><strong>Taxation of income and capital</strong></p>
<p id="V1-I-P019">19.  For the purpose of eliminating double taxation, the Convention establishes two categories of rules. First, Articles <a href="#A006">6</a> to <a href="#A021">21</a> determine, with regard to different classes of income, the respective rights to tax of the State of source or situs and of the State of residence, and <a href="#A022">Article 22</a> does the same with regard to capital. In the case of a number of items of income and capital, an exclusive right to tax is conferred on one of the Contracting States. The other Contracting State is thereby prevented from taxing those items and double taxation is avoided. As a rule, this exclusive right to tax is conferred on the State of residence. In the case of other items of income and capital, the right to tax is not an exclusive one. As regards two classes of income (dividends and interest), although both States are given the right to tax, the amount of tax that may be imposed in the State of source is limited. Second, insofar as these provisions confer on the State of source or situs a full or limited right to tax, the State of residence must allow relief so as to avoid double taxation; this is the purpose of Articles <a href="#A023A">23 A</a> and <a href="#A023B">23 B</a>. The Convention leaves it to the Contracting States to choose between two methods of relief,i.e.the exemption method and the credit method.</p>
<p>20.  Income and capital may be classified into three classes, depending on the treatment applicable to each class in the State of source or situs:<itemizedlist></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>income and capital that may be taxed without any limitation in the State of source or situs,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>income that may be subjected to limited taxation in the State of source, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>income and capital that may not be taxed in the State of source or situs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="V1-I-P020"></itemizedlist></p>
<p>21.  The following are the classes of income and capital that may be taxed without any limitation in the State of source or situs:<itemizedlist></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>income from immovable property situated in that State (including income from agriculture or forestry), gains from the alienation of such property, and capital representing it (<a href="#A006">Article 6</a> and <a href="#A013-P001">paragraph 1</a> of Articles <a href="#A013">13</a> and <a href="#A022">22</a>) as well as gains from the alienation of shares deriving more than 50 per cent of their value from such property (paragraph 4 of Article 13);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>profits of a permanent establishment situated in that State, gains from the alienation of such a permanent establishment, and capital representing movable property forming part of the business property of such a permanent establishment (<a href="#A007">Article 7</a> and <a href="#A013-P002">paragraph 2</a> of Articles 13 and 22); an exception is made, however, if the permanent establishment is maintained for the purposes of international shipping, inland waterways transport, and international air transport (see <a href="#V1-I-P023">paragraph 23</a> below);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>income from the activities of artistes and sportsmen exercised in that State, irrespective of whether such income accrues to the artiste or sportsman himself or to another person (<a href="#A017">Article 17</a>);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>directors’ fees paid by a company that is a resident of that State (<a href="#A016">Article 16</a>);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>remuneration in respect of an employment in the private sector, exercised in that State, unless the employee is present therein for a period not exceeding 183 days in any twelve month period commencing or ending in the fiscal year concerned and certain conditions are met; and remuneration in respect of an employment exercised aboard a ship or aircraft operated internationally or aboard a boat, if the place of effective management of the enterprise is situated in that State (<a href="#A015">Article 15</a>);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>subject to certain conditions, remuneration and pensions paid in respect of government service (<a href="#A019">Article 19</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="V1-I-P021"></itemizedlist></p>
<p>22.  The following are the classes of income that may be subjected to limited taxation in the State of source:<itemizedlist></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>dividends: provided the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is not effectively connected with a permanent establishment in the State of source, that State must limit its tax to 5 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends, where the beneficial owner is a company that holds directly at least 25 per cent of the capital of the company paying the dividends, and to 15 per cent of their gross amount in other cases (<a href="#A010">Article 10</a>);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>interest: subject to the same proviso as in the case of dividends, the State of source must limit its tax to 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest, except for any interest in excess of a normal amount (<a href="#A011">Article 11</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="V1-I-P022"></itemizedlist></p>
<p id="V1-I-P023">23.  Other items of income or capital may not be taxed in the State of source or situs; as a rule they are taxable only in the State of residence of the taxpayer. This applies, for example, to royalties (<a href="#A012">Article 12</a>), gains from the alienation of shares or securities (<a href="#A013-P005">paragraph 5</a> of Article 13, subject to the exception of <a href="#A013-P004">paragraph 4</a> of Article 13), private sector pensions (<a href="#A018">Article 18</a>), payments received by a student for the purposes of his education or training (<a href="#A020">Article 20</a>), and capital represented by shares or securities (<a href="#A022-P004">paragraph 4</a> of <a href="#A022">Article 22</a>). Profits from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic or of boats engaged in inland waterways transport, gains from the alienation of such ships, boats, or aircraft, and capital represented by them, are taxable only in the State in which the place of effective management of the enterprise is situated (<a href="#A008">Article 8</a> and <a href="#A013-P003">paragraph 3</a> of Articles 13 and 22). Business profits that are not attributable to a permanent establishment in the State of source are taxable only in the State of residence (<a href="#A007-P001">paragraph 1</a> of Article 7).</p>
<p id="V1-I-P024">24.  Where a resident of a Contracting State receives income from sources in the other Contracting State, or owns capital situated therein, that in accordance with the Convention is taxable only in the State of residence, no problem of double taxation arises, since the State of source or situs must refrain from taxing that income or capital.</p>
<p>25.  Where, on the contrary, income or capital may, in accordance with the Convention, be taxed with or without limitation in the State of source or situs, the State of residence has the obligation to eliminate double taxation. This can be accomplished by one of the following two methods:<itemizedlist></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>exemption method: income or capital that is taxable in the State of source or situs is exempted in the State of residence, but it may be taken into account in determining the rate of tax applicable to the taxpayer’s remaining income or capital;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>credit method: income or capital that is taxable in the State of source or situs is subject to tax in the State of residence, but the tax levied in the State of source or situs is credited against the tax levied by the State of residence on such income or capital.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="V1-I-P025"></itemizedlist></p>
<p id="">25.1  It follows from the preceding explanations that, throughout the Convention, the words “may be taxed in” a Contracting State mean that that State is granted the right to tax the income to which the relevant provision applies and that these words do not affect the right to tax of the other Contracting State, except through the application of <a href="#A023A">Article 23 A</a>  <a href="#A023B">or 23 B</a> when that other State is the State of residence.</p>
<p><strong>Special provisions</strong></p>
<p>26.  There are a number of special provisions in the Convention. These provisions concern:<itemizedlist></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the elimination of tax discrimination in various circumstances (<a href="#A024">Article 24</a>);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the establishment of a mutual agreement procedure for eliminating double taxation and resolving conflicts of interpretation of the Convention (<a href="#A025">Article 25</a>);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the exchange of information between the tax authorities of the Contracting States (<a href="#A026">Article 26</a>);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the assistance by Contracting States in the collection of each other’s taxes (<a href="#A027">Article 27</a>);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the tax treatment of members of diplomatic missions and consular posts in accordance with international law (<a href="#A028">Article 28</a>);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the territorial extension of the Convention (<a href="#A029">Article 29</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="V1-I-P026"></itemizedlist></p>
<h2 id="general-remarks-on-the-model-convention">General remarks on the Model Convention<a class="headerlink" href="#general-remarks-on-the-model-convention" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p id="V1-I-P027">27.  The Model Convention seeks, wherever possible, to specify for each situation a single rule. On certain points, however, it was thought necessary to leave in the Convention a certain degree of flexibility, compatible with the efficient implementation of the Model Convention. Member countries therefore enjoy a certain latitude, for example, with regard to fixing the rate of tax at source on dividends and interest and the choice of method for eliminating double taxation. Moreover, for some cases, alternative or additional provisions are mentioned in the Commentaries.</p>
<p><strong>Commentaries on the Articles</strong></p>
<p id="V1-I-P028">28.  For each Article in the Convention, there is a detailed Commentary that is intended to illustrate or interpret its provisions.</p>
<p id="V1-I-P029">29.  As the Commentaries have been drafted and agreed upon by the experts appointed to the Committee on Fiscal Affairs by the Governments of member countries, they are of special importance in the development of international fiscal law. Although the Commentaries are not designed to be annexed in any manner to the conventions signed by member countries, which unlike the Model are legally binding international instruments, they can nevertheless be of great assistance in the application and interpretation of the conventions and, in particular, in the settlement of any disputes.</p>
<p id="V1-I-P029.01">29.1  The tax administrations of member countries routinely consult the Commentaries in their interpretation of bilateral tax treaties. The Commentaries are useful both in deciding day-to-day questions of detail and in resolving larger issues involving the policies and purposes behind various provisions. Tax officials give great weight to the guidance contained in the Commentaries.</p>
<p id="V1-I-P029.02">29.2  Similarly, taxpayers make extensive use of the Commentaries in conducting their businesses and planning their business transactions and investments. The Commentaries are of particular importance in countries that do not have a procedure for obtaining an advance ruling on tax matters from the tax administration as the Commentaries may be the only available source of interpretation in that case.</p>
<p id="V1-I-P029.03">29.3  Bilateral tax treaties are receiving more and more judicial attention as well. The courts are increasingly using the Commentaries in reaching their decisions. Information collected by the Committee on Fiscal Affairs shows that the Commentaries have been cited in the published decisions of the courts of the great majority of member countries. In many decisions, the Commentaries have been extensively quoted and analysed, and have frequently played a key role in the judge’s deliberations. The Committee expects this trend to continue as the worldwide network of tax treaties continues to grow and as the Commentaries gain even more widespread acceptance as an important interpretative reference.</p>
<p id="V1-I-P030">30.  Observations on the Commentaries have sometimes been inserted at the request of member countries that are unable to concur in the interpretation given in the Commentary on the Article concerned. These observations thus do not express any disagreement with the text of the Convention, but usefully indicate the way in which those countries will apply the provisions of the Article in question. Since the observations are related to the interpretations of the Articles given in the Commentaries, no observation is needed to indicate a country’s wish to modify the wording of an alternative or additional provision that the Commentaries allow countries to include in their bilateral conventions.</p>
<p><strong>Reservations of certain member countries on some provisions of the Convention</strong></p>
<p id="V1-I-P031">31.  Although all member countries are in agreement with the aims and the main provisions of the Model Convention, nearly all have entered reservations on some provisions, which are recorded in the Commentaries on the Articles concerned. There has been no need for countries to make reservations indicating their intent to use the alternative or additional provisions that the Commentaries allow countries to include in their bilateral conventions or to modify the wording of a provision of the Model to confirm or incorporate an interpretation of that provision put forward in the Commentary. It is understood that insofar as a member country has entered reservations, the other member countries, in negotiating bilateral conventions with the former, will retain their freedom of action in accordance with the principle of reciprocity.</p>
<p id="V1-I-P032">32.  The Committee on Fiscal Affairs considers that these reservations should be viewed against the background of the very wide areas of agreement that has been achieved in drafting this Convention.</p>
<p><strong>Relation with previous versions</strong></p>
<p id="V1-I-P033">33.  When drafting the 1977 Model Convention, the Committee on Fiscal Affairs examined the problems of conflicts of interpretation that might arise as a result of changes in the Articles and Commentaries of the 1963 Draft Convention. At that time, the Committee considered that existing conventions should, as far as possible, be interpreted in the spirit of the revised Commentaries, even though the provisions of these conventions did not yet include the more precise wording of the 1977 Model Convention. It was also indicated that member countries wishing to clarify their positions in this respect could do so by means of an exchange of letters between competent authorities in accordance with the mutual agreement procedure and that, even in the absence of such an exchange of letters, these authorities could use mutual agreement procedures to confirm this interpretation in particular cases.</p>
<p id="V1-I-P034">34.  The Committee believes that the changes to the Articles of the Model Convention and the Commentaries that have been made since 1977 should be similarly interpreted.</p>
<p id="V1-I-P035">35.  Needless to say, amendments to the Articles of the Model Convention and changes to the Commentaries that are a direct result of these amendments are not relevant to the interpretation or application of previously concluded conventions where the provisions of those conventions are different in substance from the amended Articles. However, other changes or additions to the Commentaries are normally applicable to the interpretation and application of conventions concluded before their adoption, because they reflect the consensus of the OECD member countries as to the proper interpretation of existing provisions and their application to specific situations.</p>
<p id="V1-I-P036">36.  Whilst the Committee considers that changes to the Commentaries should be relevant in interpreting and applying conventions concluded before the adoption of these changes, it disagrees with any form ofa contrariointerpretation that would necessarily infer from a change to an Article of the Model Convention or to the Commentaries that the previous wording resulted in consequences different from those of the modified wording. Many amendments are intended to simply clarify, not change, the meaning of the Articles or the Commentaries, and sucha contrariointerpretations would clearly be wrong in those cases.</p>
<p id="V1-I-P036.01">36.1  Tax authorities in member countries follow the general principles enunciated in the preceding four paragraphs. Accordingly, the Committee on Fiscal Affairs considers that taxpayers may also find it useful to consult later versions of the Commentaries in interpreting earlier treaties.</p>
<p><strong>Multilateral convention</strong></p>
<p id="V1-I-P037">37.  When preparing the 1963 Draft Convention and the 1977 Model Convention, the Committee on Fiscal Affairs considered whether the conclusion of a multilateral tax convention would be feasible and came to the conclusion that this would meet with great difficulties. It recognised, however, that it might be possible for certain groups of member countries to study the possibility of concluding such a convention among themselves on the basis of the Model Convention, subject to certain adaptations they might consider necessary to suit their particular purposes.</p>
<p id="V1-I-P038">38.  The Nordic Convention on Income and Capital entered into by Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, which was concluded in 1983 and replaced in 1987, 1989 and 1996,<sup id="fnref:7"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7">1</a></sup> provides a practical example of such a multilateral convention between a group of member countries and follows closely the provisions of the Model Convention.</p>
<p id="V1-I-P039">39.  Also relevant is the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, which was drawn up within the Council of Europe on the basis of a first draft prepared by the Committee on Fiscal Affairs. This Convention entered into force on 1 April 1995.</p>
<p id="V1-I-P040">40.  Despite these two conventions, there are no reasons to believe that the conclusion of a multilateral tax convention involving all member countries could now be considered practicable. The Committee therefore considers that bilateral conventions are still a more appropriate way to ensure the elimination of double taxation at the international level.</p>
<p><strong>Tax avoidance and evasion; improper use of conventions</strong></p>
<p id="V1-I-P041">41.  The Committee on Fiscal Affairs continues to examine both the improper use of tax conventions and international tax evasion. The problem is referred to in the Commentaries on several Articles. In particular, <a href="#A026">Article 26</a>, as clarified in the Commentary, enables States to exchange information to combat these abuses.</p>
